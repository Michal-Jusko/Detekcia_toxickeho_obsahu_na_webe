"Azealia Banks In Twitter War With Perez Hilton

Twitter was a-buzz Friday night with a Twitter war between allegedly bisexual, young rapper Azealia Banks and celebrity gossiper Perez Hilton. Azealia is not new to drama in the rap community, as MTV News points out, but this fight all began with Perez asking Azealia about another tiff she recently had going on, which triggered Azealia to respond in a, well, not so friendly matter: ""[Perez] get the fuck outta here dickbreath. U were just riding my clit yesterday..... Kick rox."" Classy right?

More statements were traded between the two as Perez continued to provoke Azealia: ""[Azealia] Some of your music is cute, but your attention-seeking ways are pathetic and hurtful. You drag while others choose to uplift!""

Which led her to not only wish his death, but to use a very homophobic slur and providing us a new definition to it: ""A faggot is not a homosexual male. A faggot is any male who acts like a female. There's a BIG difference."" Quite the shot to both gay men and women.

It was here that caused several others to reply in support of Perez, but more so in support of calling out Azealia for using the slur and educating her in how nasty using it truly was. Among them was filmmaker and LGBT activist Ryan James Yezak, who recently released a video montage of 2012. Ryan tweeted: ""We shouldn't hate on [Azealia] for her use of derogatory words - this should be used as an opportunity to help her learn & understand.""

The war continued on, with Azealia sinking deeper: ""When I said acts like I female I should've said acts like a cunt."" But Perez still kept on heckling her: ""You are such a poet!""

By the end, Azealia realized how she could've offended people, at least she tried to come off that way: ""My most sincere apologies to anyone who was indirectly offended by my foul language. Not sorry for Perez tho. Lol."" She said goodnight shortly after to her followers, and Perez retweeted comments from supporters and countless new posts he created.

While at least Azealia tweeted an apology, some question its sincerity, and it does not justify using it. In the end, there were no winners in this fight, and only time will tell how this will all play when Azealia's debut album, Broke With Expensive Taste, FINALLY releases Feburary 12.

UPDATE

Azealia replied to all the Twitter comments: ""Really not as moved by this f word thing as u all want me to be. As a bisexual person I knew what I meant when I used that word ... And I meant what I meant when I used that word.""

Scissor Sisters' Jake Shears also provided his thoughts prior to Azealia's latest remarks: ""Oh yeah. 'Faggot.' Totally cool. Give me a fucking break ... [It's] all about context. And right now, I'm sorry, but context is not on your side.""

He also brought up Donna Summers' similar actions: ""[She] was ostracized for a decade from words she used about her gay fans. Too bad she didn't have twitter to recant them immediately.""",1,en,1

"Reductive cleavage mechanism of methylcobalamin: elementary steps of Co-C bond breaking.
Density functional theory has been applied to the investigation of the reductive cleavage mechanism of methylcobalamin (MeCbl). In the reductive cleavage of MeCbl, the Co-C bond is cleaved homolytically, and formation of the anion radical ([MeCbl]*-) reduces the dissociation energy by approximately 50%. Such dissociation energy lowering in [MeCbl]*- arises from the involvement of two electronic states: the initial state, which is formed upon electron addition, has dominant pi*corrin character, but when the Co-C bond is stretched the unpaired electron moves to the sigma*Co-C state, and the final cleavage involves the three-electron (sigma)2(sigma*)1 bond. The pi*corrin-sigma*Co-C states crossing does not take place at the equilibrium geometry of [MeCbl]*- but only when the Co-C bond is stretched to 2.3 A. In contrast to the neutral cofactor, the most energetically efficient cleavage of the Co-C bond is from the base-off form. The analysis of thermodynamic and kinetic data provides a rationale as to why Co-C cleavage in reduced form requires prior departure of the axial base. Finally, the possible connection of present work to B12 enzymatic catalysis and the involvement of anion-radical-like [MeCbl]*- species in relevant methyl transfer reactions is discussed.",0,en,0

"4-Aminobiphenyl induces liver DNA adducts in both neonatal and adult mice but induces liver mutations only in neonatal mice.
The mechanisms underlying the susceptibility of neonatal mice to genotoxic carcinogens were investigated by analyzing the DNA adducts and mutations induced in the livers of neonatal and adult Big Blue transgenic mice by 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), a potent human and rodent carcinogen. Neonatal and adult mice were treated with a regimen of 4-ABP known to induce tumors in neonatal mice. Animals were sacrificed 1 day after the last treatment for DNA adduct analysis and 8 weeks after the last treatment for analysis of lacI and cII mutant frequency (MF). N-(Deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-ABP was the major DNA adduct identified in the livers of the 4-ABP-treated mice and levels of this adduct were significantly higher in treated animals than in the controls for both the neonates and adults. Adduct levels for adult females (44.0 +/- 4.8 adducts/10(6) nucleotides) were higher than in neonatal females (25.9 +/- 2.2 adducts/10(6) nucleotides), while adduct levels in adult males (13.5 +/- 2.0 adducts/10(6) nucleotides) were lower than in neonatal males (33.8 +/- 4.1 adducts/10(6) nucleotides). 4-ABP treatment significantly increased the liver cII MFs in both sexes of neonatal mice but not in adult mice. Sequence analysis of cII mutant DNA revealed that 4-ABP induced a unique spectrum of mutations in neonatal mice, characterized by a high frequency of G:C-->T:A transversion, while the mutation spectrum in 4-ABP-treated adults was similar to that of control mice. Our results indicate that DNA adduct formation by 4-ABP depends as much on sex as it does on age, whereas the conversion of DNA adducts into mutations differed with animal age. These observations suggest that neonates are more sensitive than adults to genotoxic carcinogens because the relatively high levels of cell division in the developing animal facilitate the conversion of DNA damage into mutation.

"Cafferty to Blitzer: 'Don't make excuses' for Palin RAW STORY

Published: Friday September 26, 2008





Print This Email This For those who feel sympathy for Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin during her recent response to a question on the bailout, here is a word of advice.



Don't tell Jack Cafferty.



The CNN anchorman lambasted Palin for her thoughts on the $700 billion bailout proposed by the Bush administration. After showing a clip of the Alaskan governor's Friday interview with Katie Couric on CBS' The Early Show, he had this to say.



""If John McCain wins, this woman will be one 72-year-old's heartbeat away from being president of the United States, and if that doesn't scare the hell out of you, it should,"" Cafferty said.



He asked viewers to write in opinions about Palin's qualifications for the presidency and then turned to Wolf Blitzer and said this:



""I'm 65 and have been covering politics, as have you, for a long time. That is one of the most pathetic pieces of tape I of ever seen for someone aspiring to one of the highest offices in this country.""

Maybe that's not entirely accurate, like saying he shot at the tree trimmers when he actually pointed away from them isn't accurate.

If he was actually shooting at anyone to hit them, for someone reported to be an excellent marksman, he sure did miss a lot, as in everyone he supposedly shot at.

Out of fairness to everyone involved, it is better to be accurate in reporting and our descriptions of what transpired.

"Corruption, greed, and moral squalor: The scandals of football that SHOULD be tackled

When it comes to the issue of race, the Crown Prosecution Service appears to be riddled with double standards. Earlier this month, a Leicester court heard the shocking case of a white woman, Rhea Page, who was attacked on the street by a four-strong gang of Somalian girls.Pulled to the ground, Ms Page was repeatedly kicked by her assailants amid cries of ‘white slag’ and ‘kill the white bitch’.

Despite their brutality, the attackers were given only suspended sentences. More remarkably, the Crown Prosecution Service refused to charge them with racially aggravated assault, even in the face of Ms Page’s powerful testimony about their vicious language towards her.

Yet now the very same organisation that was so dismissive of any racial element in the Leicester case has decided to take the England and Chelsea captain John Terry to court over a racist remark he allegedly made to the Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during a match in London. Terry denies the charge and has said he will vigorously contest the case, which is likely to drag on into next summer.

Clash: John Terry will face prosecution over an alleged racist remark made to the Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand

I hold no candle for John Terry — in fact, quite the opposite — and any racist language is, of course, repugnant and offensive.

However, to treat a comment made on the pitch during a fiery Premier League clash as a matter for a full-blown criminal prosecution shows not only a lack of any sense of proportion, but also a disturbing eagerness to indulge in gesture politics.

Even many blacks feel that the issue has been overblown. Yesterday the Kenyan-born writer and academic Edwin Okong’o said that as a black man, he found the prosecution of Terry ‘utterly ridiculous’.

It is absurd that the incident is being handled by the judiciary at all. What this sorry saga demonstrates is both the hysteria of the Crown Prosecution Service and the hysteria within football over race relations.

Across the game there is the atmosphere of a witch-hunt, a self-righteous obsession with hounding those who are said to have infringed the politically correct linguistic or behavioural code.

What is so wrong about this sanctimonious indignation is that the same sense of outrage is not applied to other aspects of the sport. Football today is awash with greed, corruption, squalor and contempt for civilised conduct.

Notorious: Terry's behaviour off the pitch makes him a national disgrace

On the field, players are notorious for their cynical fouls, dangerous tackles, diving and abuse of the referee. Off the field, too many stars lead lives that would have made Nero blush, full of promiscuity and misogyny, gambling and drinking, their antics fuelled by vast pay packets that leave them disconnected from the British public.

The truth is that it’s the culture of yobbery and self-serving excess in football — not racism — that is the real problem. And John Terry personifies the very worst of it.

This is a man who earns £150,000-a-week. He captains both Chelsea and our national side, and should be an ambassador for the game and for Britain, someone for people to emulate.

Yet he is quite the opposite, He is a national disgrace. His career has been littered with appalling episodes, from brawls in bars to serial betrayals of his wife.

He drunkenly abused American tourists at Heathrow airport shortly after 9/11 and was caught urinating in a glass in a nightclub. Despite his colossal salary, his enthusiasm for exploiting his position as a Chelsea and England star is notorious. On one occasion, he allegedly accepted £10,000 for an unauthorised tour of Chelsea’s training ground. On another, it was revealed that his personal box at Wembley was being ‘touted out’ for £4,000 per match.

Terry also had an affair with the ex-girlfriend of Wayne Bridge, a former Chelsea team-mate and one of his best friends. He tried and failed to get an injunction to prevent the affair from being disclosed by newspapers before being relieved of the England captaincy, to which he has been re-instated.

And while all this revolting behaviour has been casually accepted as par for the course, the football authorities and legal establishment are only now having a fit of the vapours because of his alleged racist outburst.

Football is in the grip of a kind of McCarthyism. Just as the bullying American Senator Joe McCarthy of the Fifties saw Communists everywhere in his obsession with fighting the red menace, so football chiefs uncover racism at every turn.

Grovelling: BBC pundit Alan Hansen has been forced to apologise for using the word 'coloured' on Match of the Day

Only yesterday, highly respected BBC pundit Alan Hansen was forced to issue a grovelling apology after he used the term ‘coloured’ to describe black players.

True, the term coloured might be outdated, even insensitive — though it is worth pointing out that the leading black rights organisation in the U.S. is called The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People — but Hansen’s use of the word was hardly evidence that he is a closet racist. Yet you would not know it from all the outrage he attracted. Some denounced him, others even called for his sacking.

Laughably, the former striker Stan Collymore joined in the chorus of disapproval. Collymore is in no position to sit in moral judgement on anyone, given that he once savagely beat up his then girlfriend, the TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson, in a Paris bar.

It is the same story over Sepp Blatter, the president of football’s governing body Fifa. During his 13 years in power, Blatter has presided over a moral cesspit, riddled with financial abuses and voting manipulation.

Despite his sorry record, he was re-elected unopposed for a third term this year. It was only when he offended the politically correct brigade that his position came under threat, after he recently gave an interview in which he said that there was no problem with racism in football, and that any tensions on the field could be settled with a handshake.

Again, there was the usual grandstanding, accompanied by breast-beating and demands for a resignation. Never one to see a passing bandwagon without jumping onboard, Labour leader Ed Miliband called for Blatter’s departure, describing his comments as ‘a disgrace’.

The mood is all-pervasive. This week, the mixed-race Liverpool player Luis Suarez, from Uruguay, was fined £40,000 and banned for eight matches for allegedly racially abusing Manchester United’s Senegalese-born full-back Patrice Evra.

He would have received nothing like that punishment if he had inflicted a career-ending tackle on Evra or been caught in a hotel orgy.

Suarez is appealing and insists he did not commit any racist act. He says he called Evra ‘something his team mates at Manchester United call him, and even they were surprised by his reaction’.

His fellow Uruguayan Gus Poyet, now manager of Brighton, ame to Suarez’s defence, saying the sentence was ‘incredible, shocking and disproportionate’, adding that the incident had arisen because of Suarez’s lack of understanding about European culture.

‘Uruguay people and South Americans experience these situations with coloured people.’

I suppose Poyet, after using the term coloured, will be the next target after Hansen.

The tragedy of this politically correct outcry is it obscures the real progress made in tackling racism within football. No longer is the game scarred by abusive skinheads or violent hooligans, as happened in the Seventies and Eighties. Racist chanting at grounds has been massively reduced.

Moreover, players from ethnic minorities are increasingly influential. More than 30 per cent of all footballers in the Premiership are black, while the England team under Fabio Capello has had an average of five blacks in every game. That is a matter of great national pride.

Yet this has done nothing to reduce the hysteria of the authorities. Only yesterday, it was reported in the Mail that Tottenham Hotspur was to employ staff wearing cameras on their headgear to look out in the crowds for any displays of racism or homophobia at last night’s game against Chelsea.

‘Stewards will adopt a zero-tolerance policy,’ says Tottenham proudly. ‘We do not tolerate discrimination of any sort at the club.’

This is truly Orwellian, with the citizenry under close surveillance by the self-appointed commissars of political correctness. We would never tolerate such aggressive intrusion in other aspects of our lives.

Football would have far more credibility over race if it had put its own house in order on other issues.

There is a yawning chasm between its zero tolerance on race discrimination and its tolerance of grubbiness, greed and sordid self-indulgence that dominate the beautiful game.

Indeed, I don’t think it’s going too far to say that football’s moral posturing is almost as offensive as any of the primitive language that may come out of John Terry’s mouth.

"Why I was wrong about the Star and the Express

The Desmond empire's decision to embrace the Health Lottery has not calmed the papers' editorial pol

Back in March, a rather misguided but well-intentioned blogger wrote about Richard Desmond's plans for a health lottery. ""It could raise a lot of money for charity and it could mark the end of the bad old days for the Express and the Star,"" wrote that fool, claiming that the philanthropic endeavour was aimed ""with one eye on detoxifying his newspaper brands.""

This idiot blundered on: ""Pandering to Little Englanders every now and again might have done a good job in retaining a few hardcore readers for the Express and the Star, but that kind of tactic might become a hindrance."" Oh, you have to wince.

The fool, if you haven't realised by now, was me. A month on from the launch of the Health Lottery in a rainbow-coloured vomit of excitement, has anything really changed in the Desmond empire? Have these newspapers become milder, less rabid, more measured, as they now share an umbrella with the beneficent health lotto project? Well, it's not looking tremendously promising. (The health lottery itself isn't looking tremendously promising either, but that's another story.)

I suppose the point I was making back in March was that it would be difficult to sell a message of positive, embracing, warm charity fun while at the same time selling a more divisive, cold, negative message about disliking foreigners. The lottery was launched at the end of September, with the Daily Express declaring it would ""MAKE BRITAIN BETTER"" and the Daily Star saying it was a ""TONIC FOR BRITAIN"". But did the content of the papers continue in such a positive vein? At first the signs seemed promising. The Express on September 29 led with news that there would be ""PAY RISE JOY FOR MILLIONS"". So far, so inoffensive. The Star said that Ed Miliband wanted to ""BAN BIG BRO FUN"", neatly mentioning Channel 5's flagship reality show. Cross-promotional as ever, and not entirely true, but not toxic. Not yet.

As October began, though, there were signs that the feelgood factor wouldn't last. ""EU RAID ON OUR PENSIONS"", boiled the Express. ""£42M CHILD BENEFIT SENT ABROAD"", grumbled the Sunday Express. ""VICTORY IN BID TO QUIT EU"", roared the Express, next to a photo of Simon Cowell, who was, wouldn't you know it, backing the Health Lottery (in a ""FRENZY"", according to the Star). A temporary bit of actual news intervened with the acquittal of tabloid favourite Amanda Knox (tastefully reported to be ""HAUNTED BY MEREDITH'S GHOST"", said the Star), and then the spleen returned.

The front page of the Express on October 14 proclaimed that ""WORKERS ARE FIRED FOR BEING BRITISH"", next to the beaming smile of early 1990s celebrity Donna Air (who was ""backing the health lottery"", shockingly enough). The headline might have led amateur readers to think that workers had been fired for being British, but a more thorough look at the words revealed it was a claim, made by an MP using parliamentary privilege, about a company and a forthcoming industrial tribunal, and not really quite as established a fact as it might at first have appeared.

In recent days, it's accelerated, with an Express ""Crusade"" relaunched on October 17 to ""GET US OUT OF THE EU"", a story saying ""75% SAY QUIT THE EU NOW"" (although the figures weren't quite that clear cut), ""THE GREAT EU REVOLT"" on October 24 and ""SCANDAL OF EU BETRAYAL"" on October 25. It took a somewhat more sinister turn with ""GERMANY WARNS OF WAR IN EUROPE"" on October 27, above a story which, you may be not entirely knocked down with a feather to learn, didn't exactly reflect Germany warning of a war in Europe. A day later, apparently, the FRENCH were sending ""UNEMPLOYED TO BRITAIN ON CUT-PRICE TRAINS TO STEAL OUR JOBS."" (And do what with them? Take them back to France? ""Haha, you English fools, I have stolen your £6-an-hour job in the kitchen in Spud-u-like and am transporting it to Marseille!"")

All those months ago, I had hoped that the arrival of the Health Lottery might spike the guns of the Express and Star a little, but I am not so sure it has. While the Star appears to have retreated from political front pages altogether for the time being, becoming more and more obsessed with celebrities (particularly female celebrities in their pants), the Express has ploughed the same old furrow. Those foreigners, stealing our jobs! Those Germans! War in Europe! Get us out now! Oh, and by the way, buy a lottery ticket - 21p from every pound goes to charity!

Whatever happens with the Health Lottery, it doesn't appear its presence will, after all, be a calming influence on the editorial policy of its papers. Someone somewhere must have reasoned that the anti-EU stories flog papers, and that's not going to stop anytime soon. It's always a shame to say you were wrong, but I think I was.",1,en,1

'Betty Nuttyahoo' and AIPAC, STFU!

Around here, the last couple of weeks, the price of gasoline has jumped about 40 cents a gallon, usually after Israeli CRIME MINISTER 'Betty Nuttyahoo' makes another war mongering threat towards Iran.

I have no doubt that before these threats are bellowed out, Israel's friends on Wall Street get advance notice and place bets on the oil futures commodities markets, making ungodly sums of filthy lucre.

In a couple of weeks, the annual parade of ass-kissing Senators and Representatives will make their pilgrimage to the AIPAC 'Love Fest' and try to outdo one another in speech's given to the convention saying they just LUV Israel, that they'd do ANYTHING to protect that nation run by blood-thirsty lunatics--they won't say that, I did--and repeat that tired-ass line about ""all options being on the table.""

Plus, the Republican presidential candidates, Romney, Santorum, Gingrich, now confirmed to speak to Policy conference, March 6 will be reading from a teleprompter with the lies and lines written by some Zionist war monger.

And the 'first Jewish president,' Barry Sotero, will also be braying at the AIPAC conference like the jack-ass he is, old 'Mr. Hope and Change' will be kowtowing to his Zionist Masters.

I tried to capture the pic that is at this AIPAC link, showing the traitorous Americans that will be groveling towards Zionist Israel, but I could not capture the whole page, just bits and pieces.

Guess they didn't want inquiring assholes like me posting that pic on a blog dedicated to finding 9/11 Truth; being Pro-Palestinian and anti-Occupation and against these 'Wars for Wall Street and Israel.'

They will be wearing hula skirts and dance the night away shamelessly like virgins ready to be sacrificed to some pagan lord. All of 'em going to do their best ass licking & bending backwards tricks to please the real boss of America; yes, that will be nuttyyahoo. That's all you have to do to win presidency and escape yhvh's wrath.

Who will nutty pick? Only yhvh knows. Although it doesn't matter, nutty will butt rape all of 'em before picking the next American Idiot on israhell's behalf.

Did you see arrogance of sanitorium lately? Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum says the notion of religion not playing role in politics “makes me want to throw up."" .......The former Pennsylvania senator was referring to John F. Kennedy’s famous 1960 speech that argued religion should be separate from politics. ""I don't believe in an America where the separation between church and state is absolute,"" he said.http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2012/02/santorum-jfk-speech-makes-him-115569.html

He doesn't even qualify to be JFK's shit if he try! sanitorium makes all of us sick and unfortunately he is like an obnoxious remnant shit stuck on the toilet, doesn't even wanna flush out!

IMO, OBOMBA will win the 2012 election farce, since he's keeping Wall Street, the Fed and by extension, Israel very happy with his non-interference in their criminal activities, both past and present.And when that Turkish-American on the Gaza Aid Convoy got brutally murdered after Israel broke numerous interanational laws and treaties by hijacking the ship, what did OBOMBA do?

Not a damn thing. ""From the Halls of Montezuma, to the shores of Tel Aviv, we WON'T fight battles against our murderous Masters, the Israelis.""

If there's one thing Apartheid Israel loves the most, other than torturing Gazans, destroying West Bank Palestinian homes and war mongering, it's all that wealth they're stealing from Americans.

Kenny, I didn't hang around the AIPAC site too long to see the complete list of American traitors, since I don't trust that site and anytime I visit, I then run my AV software and one other thing to get all the damned bugs and tracking cookies picked up from that den of iniquity.

And since AIPAC has never followed the law and registered as a lobbying group, it might be difficult to get a complete list of whose stabbing us in the back.

Musique, Santorum claims to be a Catholic, but he's actually a Zionist/Evangelical hybrid who was so unpopular in his home state, he couldn't win re-election, but all of that can be smoothed over with money, lots and lots of money...and threats..... and bribes.

"The mind may sort it out and give it names—
When a man dies he dies trying to say without slurring
The abruptly decaying sounds. It is true
That only flesh dies, and spirit flowers without stop
For men, cows, dung, for all dead things; and it is good, yes—

But an incarnation is in particular flesh
And the dust that is swirled into a shape
And crumbles and is swirled again had but one shape
That was this man. When he is dead the grass
Heals what he suffered, but he remains dead,
And the few who loved him know this until they die.

-Galway Kinnell, from “Freedom, New Hampshire”

The death of Philip Seymour Hoffman has been met in equal parts by deservedly effusive praise for the man’s art and the bizarre, prurient, voyeuristic, and pornographic interest in the particulars of his demise by apparent opiate overdose; heroin remains one of the few real taboos left, one of the few almost unspeakable deviancies, and, as such, some people just can’t stop talking about it. The prolific internet presence, General Gandhi, in his Twitter incarnation, noted maybe the most egregiously awful example, published in Esquire and Elle:

“Would Matt Damon ever be found dead, with a syringe still hanging from his arm?” — a real sentence about PS Hoffman’s death, in Elle

The sentence is pretty astonishingly tasteless on its own, but to appreciate the depth of its stupidity, you have to read it in context and realize that its author, Tom Junod, hasn’t just stumbled into a graceless or infelicitous comparison, but has deliberately and knowingly set up a pair of competing schemas: on the one hand, you have George Clooney and Matt Damon, who “have too much to lose,” and are therefore psychically and spiritually immune to the lure of addiction; on the other, you have Hoffman and Gandolfini, “whose work has the element of ritual sacrifice.” This kind of casual, causal linking of transgressive genius to substance abuse has the fetid scent of an adolescent bedroom. Put down your bongs, guys. This shit’s about to get real.

My brother died in 2009 in similar circumstances—not, as the ghoulish, now-standard description goes, “with a needle in his arm”, but alone in a cheap motel room that our parents had rented for him, because, when they’d allowed him into the house, he’d stolen, and yet by that point, he’d haveotherwise been living in his car. But, you have to understand, the last six desperate months of his life were sudden and alien to him, and to us. He was far more Matt Damon than Hoffman: a handsome, athletic man with an unaffected smile and uncanny personal charm; old high-school teachers who’d given him nothing but Cs (when he probably deserved to fail) remembered him as one of their favorite students; old girlfriends never seemed to get angry with him. He bounced from job to job (a signal, in retrospect, but at the time, we saw it as an overly gregarious and under-focused twentysomething’s natural fecklessness and indecision; it would eventually correct itself). Mostly he bartended, and he was an excellent bartender. He was never much of a drinker—mostly wine and beer, and rarely in any quantity. Like a lot of bartenders and other such nocturnal creatures, he dabbled in cocaine. If you’d have asked me a year before he died what his biggest problem was, I’d have told you it was that he partied a little too often, although that, too, seemed like nothing more than the kind of mild, youthful vice that we all, mostly, grow out of.

In fact, my brother had been a daily opiate user for the better part of a decade. He never did finish college, but he spent a few years at West Virginia University, and as a freshman, he’d badly broken his leg during a game of pickup soccer. After the surgery, he’d started on pain killers, and when the prescription ran out, he got them elsewhere—codeine, oxy, and eventually, Fentanyl and heroin. I was anything but naïve about drugs myself; I’d at least tried most of them; my best friend struggled with heroin; my boyfriend at the time was a recovering alcoholic and drug addict—and for all this, I never saw it in my brother, never suspected, never knew until it was too late. He was locked in that motel room, and he was dead. Would Nathan Bacharach ever be found dead with a pile of broken pills hidden in the sock drawer?

I don’t suggest that we turn away from the circumstances of death—the opposite of pornography is a prudish sterility that’s equally awful. But if George Clooney died of prostate cancer, would we take the occasion to make it a reflection on the type of roles he chose? It is one thing to learn to gaze without flinching at the cause of a man’s death, another entirely to treat his illness as a mere foible of his eccentric genius. Hoffman had a family. They knew, or they did not know, the extent and late stage of his disease, but what consolation is it to them, or to anyone who knew him, for a stranger to offer his sickness as a slick metaphor for his professional artistry, a cheap window-dressing on his soul? An actor’s art is doubtlessly informed by his person and his inner being, and Hoffman doubtlessly drew on his own sense and memory of darkness in performing it, but he was a great actor not because of his addiction, but in spite of it, and he did not die because he was a genius, but because he was a man—all of us have our end, but none of us deserves it.

it’s unfortunate that’s what some people will remember him for.Not for his talent in films like Love Liza or Capote.I was a heroin addict for a few years,Now I’m on the methadone program.And to my friends and family,that’s what will define me from here on out.even if I live to be 113.

Good luck to you and your recovery. And I hope your family can learn to see more to you than that someday. I’ve known a few heroin addicts in my professional life, but their additctions aren’t what I remember about them.

He was a talented man and it’s a shame he didn’t live until he was old and grey.. I don’t care how he died.. The fact is that he did and he’s left behind grieving family and friends. The world lost a talented man but what’s that compared to a child losing their father?

This gave me goosebumps. So raw. Thank you. And I am sorry for the loss of your brother. Unfortunately, Hoffman’s grim end is now part of his life story (we all have parts we might not want to be remembered for) and one that people shouldn’t shy away from discussing. It doesn’t mean people will always focus on his drug addiction, it’s just in their faces daily thanks to the media. I challenge you to watch Capote (again hopefully?) as soon as possible and not think he is even greater an actor. I choose to remember him for his talent and feel sad that addiction took him, like so many others, too soon. RIP.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us, Jake. I think the truth is that there is a lot of good in this world and there is a lot of greed and idiocy too. This will never change. What we have to do is focus on the good and try to ignore the greedy and the idiots.

Peace be with your brother and your family. And likewise for Philip and his.

I am very saddened too hear your story about your brother. I am planning to soon write a post too about this topic, from the point of view of when I used to practice as a pharmacist and had to treat my opiate addiction patients.

People can be so ignorant. Heroin and addiction can touch anyone in any walk of life. I have seen this firsthand. It does not matter if you are homeless or physician living in a mansion in the Hills. Who is to say that Matt Damon does not simply have a wonderful p.r. person who protects his image and allows the public to see only what they want it to see? Addiction does not discriminate.

I thought, when the recent spate of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Fentanyl deaths (China White, etcetera …..), hit the noooz, that you might comment. Had not not thought your brother’s death was via Fentanyl. I feel for you, while I know at least three in Pittsburgh, who died via China White, and am too familiar with those who make the decision that they don’t really want to wake up tomorrow to endure more pain, I never had a sibling die from a drug which is clearly being provided from someone[s] who is quite hooked up with the powers that be.

I’m curious if you have any thought why Fentanyl deaths are so historically connected to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, more so than most other cities?

I dated someone, while still living in Pitt’s Berg,whose life seemed cut off way too young by China White, ….

"New Organ Transplant Strategy Aims to Better Prevent Rejection

Share

UCSF News reports on the work of Qizhi Tang, Ph.D., and other UC San Francisco researchers to develop new organ transplant strategies that better prevent rejection of donated organs. The research of Dr. Tang, Associate Professor in the Division of Transplant Surgery, and Director of the Transplantation Research Lab and Tang Lab, and colleagues, is reported on in two recently published journal articles.

""Organ-transplant recipients often reject donated organs, but a new, two-pronged strategy developed by UC San Francisco researchers to specifically weaken immune responses that target transplanted tissue has shown promise in controlled experiments on mice,""

""The hope is that using this novel treatment strategy at the time of transplantation surgery could spare patients from lifelong immunosuppressive treatments and their side effects. The approach might also be used to treat autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, the researchers said.

The study was conducted in mouse studies of islet-cell transplantation – a procedure used to restore insulin secretion and control over glucose levels in the blood in patients with life-threatening diabetes. The treatment allowed more than 70 percent of mice to accept transplants without requiring any long-term treatment with immunosuppressive drugs.""

The approach, led by Diabetes Center member Qizhi Tang, PhD, (pictured right) involved using cells from donors to activate immune cells called donor-reactive effector T cells. The researchers then gave the mice a drug called cyclophosphamide, known to specifically kill activated cells.""

""In another UCSF study published online in September in AmericanJournal of Transplantation, Tang, Bluestone and colleagues described a way to preferentially grow human TREGs in a clinical laboratory that are specifically targeted to protect donor tissue.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of the donor-targeted TREGs in liver transplant patients in clinical trials, Tang said.

“We decided to go with liver transplantation first, because the therapy is new, and liver grafts are more resilient,” she said. “We are also actively seeking approval for the use of this product in kidney transplant patients. We anticipate that these trials will start later this year.”

Co-authors of Tang’s latest American Journal of Transplantation study include postdoctoral fellow Karim Lee, PhD, and research specialist Vinh Nguyen; Kyung-Mi Lee, an immunologist at Korea University, Seoul, and Sang-Mo Kang, MD, a transplant surgeon and an immunologist at UCSF.""",0,en,0

"Well, let's see now.

This is an issue that is at the heart of the current global disaster called Globalization. Will the owners of these companies be allowed to continue moving their production wherever and whenever they want to, because they can make bigger profits in say Malaysia?

"Stanford researchers wanted to test a theory: If you put Americans with different views together, it might change their minds.

They wanted to find out more about the political divide in the U.S., and they had a hypothesis that people on opposite sides of the aisle aren’t actually so sharply divided.

Researchers put 526 Americans at a resort in Texas for a weekend in September. The nonpartisan group Helena funded the $3 million weekend.

The social research organization NORC at the University of Chicago found just the right mix of diverse opinions, and Stanford’s researchers dug in as they had conversations about everything from immigration to health care.

Researcher Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at Stanford's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, says the single most important takeaway from their study was after three and a half days of talking about political issues — not politicians or candidates — the percentage of people who thought American democracy was doing “reasonably well” doubled.

Diamond says they saw many Republicans edge away from their “hostile” positions on immigration, and Democrats tended to back away from staunch positions on topics such as taxation or the universal $15 minimum wage.

They proved their theory: People on opposite sides of the aisle found themselves gravitating toward the center, he says, after discussing the issues in groups of differing opinions, hearing first-hand stories and listening to experts.

“I think it wasn't just coming face to face,” he says. “I think it was the magic of deliberation under good conditions, which don't generally prevail in our country today.”

Interview Highlights

On the researchers’ key findings

“I actually think that the single most important thing we found is that after deliberating for three and a half days with people often who sharply disagreed … and talking about issues, not candidates and personalities, but immigration, taxes, health care, the environment and foreign policy, the percentage of people who thought our democracy was doing at least reasonably well doubled from 30% to 60%. And then we found that there was significant change in opinion on the issues that the tendency was for Republicans to edge away from extremely, implacably hostile positions on immigration, and Democrats backed away from support for positions on taxation and spending. For example, universal basic income or the baby bonds proposal that looked like they were going to spend a lot of money that we might not really have.

“Most of their interaction was with one another in small groups. But then they did hear from experts as well as in plenary sessions. And they also heard presidential candidate Michael Bennett speak to this issue and say, 'Hey, I’d at least like a cut out because for certain regions of the country, because the cost of living isn't the same in every region of the country. And $15 might put a lot of people out of work in some parts of the country.' ”

On why he believes people in the study started to understand and accept different political opinions

“The good conditions [of the research] were first of all, we gave them a kind of orienting set of facts and competing arguments on each issue. Second, they had access to competing points of view there in our plenary sessions. We gave them presidential candidates from the two parties. But third, they heard not only the different arguments of their fellow Americans, but the different life experiences.

“And when Republicans had to sit in the room and hear actual immigrants talk about their motives for immigrating, there were dramatic changes away from Republican hostility to immigration and the percentage of people, particularly Republicans, who were willing to increase visas for skilled workers or unskilled workers. It jumped to 80% of the whole sample from 60% for skilled workers and the percentage of Americans who were willing to force undocumented immigrants to return to their home countries before trying to come to the U.S. and seek entry, that declined in our sample from 46% to 25%. And this was the result of the fact that Republican support for that proposal through the deliberation process plummeted.”

"Dreams or delirium? Why making the right call is important

As they approach death, hospice patients often are transported across time and space to be reunited with loved ones and relive meaningful moments. They do so in dreams and visions, which frequently are a source of great comfort, according to a recently published study. But nursing home and hospice caregivers might not be so comfortable with these dreams — which could lead to patients experiencing less peaceful deaths.

If you provide end-of-life care, chances are good that you’re familiar with “end of life dreams and vision,” or ELDVs, as the study authors termed the phenomenon. Clinicians involved in previous research have described ELDVs as “intrinsic to the dying process,” the investigators noted. Despite this, caregivers have said they fear “judgment, ridicule and embarrassment” if they talk about these dreams and visions, which probably has led to underreporting and a general lack of understanding.

For this study, the researchers didn’t have to rely on hesitant clinicians for information, because they interviewed hospice patients themselves. The authors — from the Center for Hospice & Palliative Care in upstate New York and Canisius College in Buffalo — talked with about 60 patients between January 2011 and July 2012. All met a baseline for cognitive ability and clarity, and nearly 90% reported having at least one dream or vision.

Unlike most clinical studies, this one tugs at the heart strings; I refer you to “Table 3. Content Category Examples.” I know, the title doesn’t sound promising. But the table compiles patients’ vivid descriptions of their dreams and visions. Here’s a sampling:

Roger (age 73) dreamt about his best friend from childhood and saw him running out of the house with hisglove and bat while laughing. They had shared a love of baseball throughout life.

Rita (age 54) dreamt of a childhood friend who caused her great pain. The friend, now deceased, appeared as an old man and said, ‘‘Sorry, you’re a good person,” and, ‘‘If you need help, just call my name.”

Tim (age 51) had dreams that included his deceased parents, grandparents and old friends who were ‘‘telling me I will be okay.” ‘‘I haven’t seen some of these people for years,” he stated, and, ‘‘I know we are going somewhere but don’t know where.”

Tim’s dream was fairly representative, the investigators determined. About 70% of patients described dreams or visions of being reunited with deceased loved ones, and about 60% had dreams about going somewhere.

ELDVs involving deceased friends or relatives had the highest average “comfort rating” on a scale devised for the study. ELDVs in general were a good thing, with more than 60% rated as comforting and less than one-fifth rated as distressing. About 20% were neither comforting nor distressing.

If these dreams provide such comfort to the dying, why might caregivers be alarmed by them? One reason could be their unusual characteristics. They typically feel extremely real to the patient, and “frequently” a dream is “carried into wakefulness” so that the dying person experiences it “as waking reality,” the authors discovered. A clinician might therefore consider an ELDV to be a hallucination or a sign of delirium.

However, ELDVs are experienced by patients “who have clear consciousness, heightened acuity and awareness of their surroundings,” the study showed. They also differ from hallucinations or delirium in “the responses they evoke,” such as “inner peace, acceptance and the sense of impending death.”

Caregivers who unnecessarily medicate in response to ELDVs might actually be robbing people of the dreams’ positive effects and increasing feelings of isolation and fear, the study authors proposed.

The takeaway from this study is straightforward: Palliative care workers should be aware of what ELDVs are and should keep their benefits in mind when making medication decisions. Yet the study obviously raises some questions and ideas that are anything but straightforward — for example, about how scientific-minded people like medical professionals respond to phenomena that are somewhat inexplicable.

I think the hesitancy of medical professionals to discuss ELDVs is understandable — “dreams and visions” sounds more like the poetry about death than the scientific literature about it. But this study reinforced for me that hospice and palliative care workers are stationed at a very mysterious frontier, between life and death; pros like registered nurse Pattie Burnham, who recently was interviewed by This American Life, have seen strange things repeatedly happen on that frontier.

When she started working at a hospice five years ago, Burnham dismissed the notion of comatose patients “waiting” for a loved one to arrive before dying, saying she considered these and similar stories “mumbo jumbo.”

“Now I’m repeating the same stuff that I heard people say when I first got there, because I’ve seen it,” she said.

It seems to me that the caregivers who are hesitant to talk about patients’ dreams and visions might rightly expect to be dismissed for spouting “mumbo jumbo.” But as this study showed, so-called mumbo jumbo might in fact be the most fruitful starting point for serious research, and the result of that research might be improved care and an easier journey for some people across the frontier of life and death.",0,en,0

"Q:

Why use a CardView instead of a RelativeLayout or LinearLayout?

I have a RecyclerView for displaying a list of items. There is this android CardView class given by android to show card layout. 
If I use a RelativeLayout and set its background to white it works the same way. Also in case of CardView I have to anyway add a childlayout to it which basically contains the all the views inside the card.
So I wanted to know if their is any benefit of using a CardView (which actually increases the hierarchy of the views) rather than a normal Layout directly.

A:

There are some advantages of cards over layouts, including:

Rounded corners, elevation, etc - visual improvements that come ""out of the box"" by just using cards
They support various lengths of the content. Actually layouts support that too, but in the context of list/grid views they are meant to have the same size, whereas cards can vary in length (for example when you show comments or descriptions)
Cards on the same hierarchy level can have different types of content/views, unlike layouts (list/grid items) which should have similar layouts when you show a collection

All these and other features can be found in the card's design guideline.
In short:

I'd use cards when I want to display a collection of items which might have different lengths/heights depending on their content (like pictures with descriptions and comments) or a high number of supplemental actions.
I'd use Relative/Linear layouts when I want to display a simple collection of items, all/most of which have the same layout and a limited amount (max 1,2 lines) of text, an icon and an action,etc. elements that are the same for all items

A:

CardView is google's way of styling RecyclerView. You can always use RelativeLayout or any other method prefered. 
According to Google's design guidelines, definition of CardView is

Cards are a convenient means of displaying content composed of
  different elements. They’re also well-suited for showcasing elements
  whose size or supported actions vary, like photos with captions of
  variable length.

Using CardView, you get the default Google's look and feel throughout your app. You can customize cardview to your needs. That is why you need to have child layouts inside CardView. Plus Material Design is all about, elevation, colors and animation. CardView can have all these in a relatively easy manner. 
It would be nice if you go through Google's design guide lines on CardView.

"Q:

Fantasy book about an empath

I read the first few chapters of a book a while ago and cannot remember the title or who it was by. All I can remember is that the main character was an empath, she plays guitar at a gig and is very antisocial, whilst playing at a gig she makes everyone feel happy but can't get to one person as the have a 'dark' vibe around them. Once leaving the gig she senses a other darkness and three guys jump and rape her in an alley, she kills them by using the emotions of their previous victims. Afterwards to faints and falls into a strangers arms. Does anyone have any idea what this book is?

A:

This is Queen of Shadows by Dianne Sylvan.
The story is about a guitar-playing empath. There's a scene where the protagonist is raped and then kills the perpetrators using her mind. At the end of the chapter she faints away and is taken into the care of a mysterious stranger.

Shortly after she picked up a guitar, Miranda Grey conquered the
Austin music scene with a newfound ability to psychically manipulate
her audience’s emotions. But as her powers outgrow her control, her
mind is increasingly invaded by haunting secrets and overwhelming
sadness. Unable to look anyone in the eye, Miranda is fast approaching
the edge of insanity – with no one to catch her fall…

She stood over them in the now-pouring rain, blood oozing down her
thighs, her hands fisted at her sides, and ground her emotions into
them like putting out a cigarette in someone’s arm. She made them feel
the fear and pain of every woman they’d raped and killed, imagining
their last thoughts. The women had mothers, daughters, boyfriends
waiting at home who would never see them again. They had hopes and
fears and possibilities that Miranda had never had. These pathetic
little men had taken all of that away. Their hatred for women had made
them bold.
One of them was begging for his life. She stared down at him, and he
flinched from her eyes, eyes no one had seen in months. He had a wife,
kids. Please. He offered her anything she wanted if she’d just let him
go.
She stared, feeling nothing. “No.”

"Jana Weckerly, the woman who took those gross photos of Jerry Jones posing with some strippers and finally emerged last week via a statement from her lawyer, has now filed a civil suit against Jerry Jones and the Dallas Cowboys alleging that Jones sexually assaulted her. Some of the allegations within it will make your skin crawl.


The lawsuit claims that on the evening when the photos were taken, back in 2009, Jones repeatedly groped Weckerly, forcibly penetrated her vagina with his fingers, and made her watch as he received oral sex from another woman. The suit also alleges that Jones and the Cowboys bullied Weckerly into keeping quiet about what happened, and coerced her into signing some sort of non-disclosure agreement. You can read the entire suit at the bottom of the page, but we've pulled some of the more relevant passages up here.


Some of the sexual assault allegations:

Defendant Jerry Jones intentionally, knowingly, and forcibly rubbed and/or grabbed Plaintiff's breasts multiple times. Defendant Jerry Jones performed these acts without the consent of Plaintiff. Defendant Jerry Jones intentionally and knowingly forced Plaintiff to touch and/or rub on his penis multiple times. Defendant Jerry Jones forced Plaintiff to perform these acts without the consent of Plaintiff. Defendant Jerry Jones intentionally, knowingly, forcibly penetrated Plaintiff's vagina with his fingers without the consent of Plaintiff. Defendant Jerry Jones intentionally and knowingly received oral sex from another female while in the presence of Plaintiff. When Defendant JERRY JONES intentionally and knowingly received oral sex from the female, he knew that Plaintiff was present and intentionally and knowingly wanted Plaintiff to see said oral sex act. Plaintiff did not want to see Defendant JERRY JONES receive oral sex from the female.

And the intimidation allegations:

Defendants Jerry Jones and Cowboys intimidated Plaintiff and told her to keep quiet and not tell anyone else ""or else"". Defendants Jerry Jones and Cowboys bullied Plaintiff into believing that she would somehow be in trouble if she told anyone about the sexual assault. Defendants Jerry Jones and Cowboys intimidated her into signing documents against her will, without giving her a copies, or access to legal counsel.

I would definitely recommend investing in indivdual companies.

When investing for dividend growth, eliminate risk.In other words, if you know and are quite sure you know what you are doing without bias, then buy individual stocks. If not, then you're likely better to start out with some money in ETFs while at the same time, ramping up your education / knowledge to the point where you can do this successfully and profitably on your own.

"Basilica of SS. Ulrich and Afra, Augsburg

The Basilica of SS. Ulrich and Afra  () Is a Catholic parish in Augsburg, in Bavaria, which originated from the Roman tomb of St. Afra, which was martyred in 304. The building is a great example of Gothic architecture in Germany; In its interior it conserves three enormous and very precious altars of Renaissance ends considered a masterpiece of the German sculpture of the period. Its high bell tower with an ""onion"" dome, which dominates the city to the south, served as a prototype for the construction of numerous baroque towers of Bavaria.

In 1577 (officially) and 1643-1644 (virtually) the church, which was called the Benedictine abbey of Saints Ulrich and Afra, was elevated to the rank of imperial abbey. On October 18, 1777, a Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart organ concert was held. On May 4, 1782, Pope Pius VI celebrated Mass in Basilica. Secularized in 1802, it entered the possession of the State of Bavaria. In 1810 the church was elevated to a parish church; from July 4, 1937, declared by Pope Pius XI, a minor basilica; and finally on May 4, 1987 was visited by Pope John Paul II.

"Image caption ""My café was my dream. I don't know what will happen to it now,"" says Geruza França

It was a slow, rainy Saturday summer evening and tourists were beginning to fill up restaurants and cafés in Macacos, a beautiful district in the valleys of Minas Gerais State.

Suddenly the evening calm was broken by the spine-chilling announcement from warning sirens.

""Attention, this is a real emergency. A dam has just broken, evacuate immediately from your homes, follow the exit route to a safe place and wait for further instructions.""

The whole place went into panic mode as tourists and residents got into their cars and clogged the town's narrow streets. Some left all of their belongings behind.

Just two weeks earlier, in neighbouring Brumadinho, an earth embankment tailings dam operated by Brazilian mining giant Vale had broken, killing 308 people. It was the worst industrial disaster in Brazil's history.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tributes to victims of the Brumadinho dam collapse at an iron-ore mine in Minas Gerais state

Everyone in Macacos thought the same thing was about to happen.

False alarm

But it was a false alarm. Vale had detected a problem in the dams and decided to sound the alert, but the dams hadn't actually been breached.

Fortunately no lives were lost, but Macacos has still been affected. This had been a paradise-like district for wealthy tourists, with high-end restaurants and elegant hotels.

It used to be fully booked all year, but now that everybody is more aware of the tailings dams in the area, nobody wants to come here. Hotel reservations have been cancelled and its most prestigious restaurant has shut down.

I visited Macacos just after Carnival week, which is usually the busiest time of the year. Most residents in lower-lying areas have had to abandon their homes. Among the few still left are business owners. But they don't know whether to wait for things to change or restart their lives and businesses elsewhere.

Image caption Tourists have stopped coming to Macacos since the Brumadinho disaster

""Our economy is over, business owners will not be able to make a living any more. All the peace and quiet we had of waking up in a safe place, is gone,"" Geruza França, who owns Café Judith, tells me.

All her savings from years of working in Europe were put into her café and properties around Macacos.

""My café was my dream. I don't know what will happen to it now. I keep thinking: did I lose my entire dream overnight? It's like someone came and snatched it all away.""

Leonardo Batista, who runs the Pousada Kumaru hostel, argues that most of the district is on higher ground and would not be affected by any dam break, but he doesn't know whether businesses will be able to convince the tourists to come back.

Safety 'revolution'

Macacos is one of dozens of districts and towns in Brazil's Minas Gerais state that are feeling the effects of the Brumadinho tragedy.

Image caption ""Now what Vale?"" asks this sign in Macacos

In the aftermath of the disaster, mining practices are finally being overhauled.

Vale and other firms, alongside local authorities, are working to eliminate the risks of further tragedies by decommissioning 50 tailings dams - draining the water from them.

After years of inaction, things are now moving. I recently visited five such dams in Minas Gerais and saw work being done in all but one.

But there are economic consequences as well. The work will take three years to finish and mining activity is being severely disrupted, with Vale having to halt production in some mines.

Having unsafe mining would be catastrophic; having no mining at all is economically devastating.

""We don't want Vale to stop mining here but we don't want to be the ones to pay for their problems,"" says mayor of Itabirito, Alex Salvador.

In his town, 65% of its revenues come from Vale operations that have now stopped due to court orders. He is already having to plan cuts in education, health and public cleaning.

Image caption Alex Salvador: ""We don't want Vale to stop mining here but we don't want to pay for their problems.""

On top of that there are safety concerns. Should the two dams near Itabirito break, the town would be hit within a few hours. Just a few days after Brumadinho, the town's authorities came up with an evacuation plan.

Itabirito now has signs pointing to escape routes and meeting points on high ground. Warning sirens will be installed next month.

Global consequences

The problems of Minas Gerais and Vale are not just affecting local economies. Global iron ore prices have soared since January, as Vale is the world's number one producer - and Minas Gerais state accounts for 45% of its iron ore output.

Iron ore was trading at $74 a tonne before Brumadinho. It reached $95 a tonne immediately afterwards and is now about $85 a tonne.

Analysts say prices will remain high for some months, as many questions remain. How much will Vale have to pay in compensation and fines? Will new mining regulations increase production costs?

In a few months, these disruptions will start pushing up the costs of steel and construction worldwide.

Yet because Vale is such a powerful player in global commodities, it is actually benefiting financially from this supply disruption.

Immediately after the disaster it saw some $19bn wiped off its share value. But as no other firm has the capability to take over Vale's market share, the iron ore price rise is now working to its advantage.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mud from the Vale dam collapse - iron ore prices have soared since the disaster

Even with drastic production cuts, Vale shares are now at the same level as they were shortly before the tragedy, increasing the anger felt by communities claiming reparation from the firm.

Stricter control

One thing is virtually unanimous amongst iron ore experts: Brazil needs stricter control of its mining practices, and decommissioning the tailings dams is a matter of urgency.

Brazilian authorities are still investigating the causes of the Brumadinho tragedy. Some Vale executives have been arrested and questioned, but no one has yet been charged.

Earlier this month Vale's chief executive Fabio Schvartsman stepped down after a disastrous appearance in Congress where he told MPs that ""Vale is a Brazilian jewel"" and ""should not be condemned"" for what he described as ""an accident"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Vale's Fabio Schvartsman was forced to step down after a disastrous press conference

Vale executives declined a BBC request for an interview. In a statement the company said it is ""100% focused on supporting those affected and responding to the dam break"".

Apart from decommissioning mines, Vale has made donations to those affected and organising relocation for those in areas at risk.

Back in Macacos, where local business owners are desperately looking for answers from Vale, there is still much anger and little faith in the company.

Geruza França is now thinking about closing down her café. What she can't understand is how such a powerful company caused so much destruction in so many people's lives.

One Direction (commonly abbreviated as 1D) are an English-Irish pop boy band based in London, comprising Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson. Zayn Malik was formerly a member leaving the band on March 25th 2015. They signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records after forming and finishing third in the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor in 2010. Propelled to international success by social media, One Direction's four albums, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013) and Four (2014) broke records, topped charts in most major markets, and generated hit singles including """"What Makes You Beautiful"""", """"Live While We're Young"""", """"Story of My Life"""" and """"Steal My Girl"""".

Their achievements include five Brit Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, eleven MTV Europe Music Awards, and nineteen Teen Choice Awards out of nineteen nominations, among many others. According to Nick Gatfield, the chairman and chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment UK, One Direction represented a $50 million business empire by June 2012. They were proclaimed 2012's """"Top New Artist"""" by Billboard. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, by April 2013, they had an estimated personal combined wealth of £25 million ($41.2m) making them the second-wealthiest musicians in the UK under 30 years of age. In 2014, Forbes listed them the second-highest earning celebrities under 30, with the group earning an estimated $75 million from June 2013 to June 2014.""""Justin Bieber is Forbes' highest-earning celebrity under 30 pocketing $80m this year... which should just about cover his costly legal woes"""".

"Burke was considered quite the scholar on Matrimonial law after he published his dissertation in 1986, arguing that mental ""deficiencies"" (specifically schizophrenia) were an impediment to the sacrament. It would be interesting to consult a canonist, but it seems that he holds the view that there are specific, defined impediments to contracting Matrimony, and specific processes for litigating those impediments, outside of which there can be no remedy -- especially what Pope Francis calls a pastoral remedy -- precisely because there are no defined criteria unless there is a formal process.

"Mr Picard well said!  There needs to be more awareness of these facts and figures. I work at a grocery store and our cigarettes by law have to be hidden behind a door(God forbid if a kid sees them). I can get fined for not asking a person 25 and under for ID, or selling to someone under age. But now this underage person, the child (who didn't see the cigarettes ) can take his parents hand and walk across to the liquor store and look at all the alcohol available. These laws need to change. Under age must Not be allowed in liquor or beer stores. Period!!!",0,en,0

"My heart goes out to the young man's parents and family. Something needs to be done about the homeless population in Eugene. Recently at a convenience store I had a conversation with a homeless man from Chicago who relocated to Eugene although he has no family or friends here. A simple google search will show that Eugene  has more resources for the homeless than most American cities and this attracts individuals from other areas of our country. It also taxes the resources for longtime Eugene residents that have fallen on hard times. The people on street corners panhandling, making our city  seem like a third world country, are a small percentage of Eugene's homeless. We have many homeless families that truly need shelter and other help to get back on their feet. Our elected local officials need to come up with solutions that do not  include our nonprofit agencies to continue being overwhelmed. An ordinance against panhandling in Eugene would be a good start.",0,en,0

For her own survival perhaps it's time to stop flying . As for the Dispatch and Alaska she's bad news. She's hurting Alaska .  Under her direction the Dispatch doesn't just report the news---they try to shape it.  On the editorial pages that's great----but in the news pages it's completely wrong.

"There are unintended consequences, of course.

1) Less families can support their children at home, through long-run competition effects wrought by financial incentives. That is, the more we support dual-income earners, the less easy it is for single-income households. This is a goal of the authors, and possibly better for gov't coffers, but not necessarily for the children.

2) As a licensed childcare centre operator, the last thing we need is yet more standards (this time federal!) to adhere to.  Already, increasing regulation in Ontario has forcing excellent childcare centres to become uneconomic to operate, shrinking childcare spaces.  Of course, the gov't at multiple levels is trying to increase spaces, but instead  ends up shrinking them through incessant meddling.  Less spaces + more regulation and oversight = higher costs. 

3) Driving up the money supply to pay for daycare might create spaces, but can make daycare more expensive.",0,en,0

"You mention twice that you need to charge clients by the hour, but why do you feel that this is necessary? Right now your clients pay you a percentage of their assets via trailer fees, what prevents you from charging a similar percentage on top of what the mutual fund expenses, which (without trailer fee) are now cheaper to begin with?
This is more or less exactly the current model - acquire clients with low net worth by charging by percentage of assets (which isn't much for low-net-worth clients) and retain them until they're wealthy enough to pay off. The only major difference is that billing is more transparent and clients now have a choice between being charged by the hour and being charged by percentage of assets on top of the same lower-fee mutual funds.",0,en,0

As previously reported, on May 1st, Dirty Cop Robert Mueller requested that sentencing of Michael Flynn be delayed for two months.

The Hill reported:

Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Tuesday requested that sentencing for former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn be delayed by at least two months. Mueller’s team and attorneys for Flynn submitted that Flynn is not ready for sentencing “due to the status of the special counsel’s investigation,” according to a court filing in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.

'Aggression: Europe 1914' Gets Delayed

Aggression: Europe 1914 brings to the player the chance of writing again the darkest history of the old continent. Between years 1914 and 1950, every women and men became slayers and victims in the most horrible wars the humankind suffered and now there is a chance to make things different.

Aggression: Europe 1914 brings to the player the chance of writing again the darkest history of the old continent. Between years 1914 and 1950, every women and men became slayers and victims in the most horrible wars the humankind suffered and now there is a chance to make things different.

This title pushes to the limit the real time strategy, thanks to a graphic engine which can support hundreds of detailed units in action at the same time, a 100% 3D scenario where every building is constructed based on hundreds of polygons and where the special effects displayed have not being seen before in games of the same genre.

Choose a nation between Germany, France, Russia or England and become more and more powerful on the way you decide: diplomacy, weaponry, infantry… You can make the other nations fighting for you, or focus on strengthening your army or be the first to develop the atomic bomb (and enjoy the amazing nuke explosions effects that our unique engine affords).

Never the chances to make history were so spectacular!

Key features:

Powerful graphic engine which can display hundreds of detailed units at the same time.

Every element of the scenario, created with hundreds of polygons, can be destroyed and each time it happens, the physics system will make it to fall in a random way.

Every unit and weapon has been created following historical information. Is up to you if you want to develop it before its historical time or not.

Is in your hands to declare the World Wars or not. You are going to write down the history between the years 1914 and 1950.",0,en,0

"Good thoughts. At a pastors' workshop in the early 80s, a theologian said, basically: ""We say that the church has Christ's mission; but perhaps we are confusing the subject and the object -- it seems more correct to say 'Christ's mission has a church now, but what Christ's mission has later on might be some we would not recognize from our perspective now'"". We don't have all the answers, which is why Francis tells us to be open to the Spirit and go where she guides us. IMHO the fact that so many people hace so many questions is a sign that the Spirit is at work among us. Same old answers just don't work. We need not fear questions.

again IMHO, Jesus meant it when he said ""I am with you always"", and I will send the Spirit to teach you to observe what I have commanded you. Many of the things we question had little, if anything, to do with Jesus, but came from an institution trying to protect its prerogatives and power. Clerical caste is one of those things.",0,en,0

"Okay, so because alison_12 asked me to, this is the beginnings of a fic. Nowhere near finished, and I think it's going to need some serious fixing before I unleash it anywhere else...but anyway.

I won't tell you who the characters are, other than dearest Jawn from the Libs, because you'll guess, eventually.

""Well, maybe if you didn't fuck it up so much, I wouldn't need to be high to make sense of you!""

""Pete, the reason we're fucking up anyway is because you're high!""

John rolled his eyes at Gary. This was just one of the many spats between their frontmen that had been getting progressively worse as the tour went on, until some nights it seemed as if the two were going to rip each other apart with their verbal sparring. He and Gary had made an unspoken agreement that usually, this was Pete and Carl's problem, and to leave them to it. However, for John, tonight was just one night too many.

""Look, why don't you two just shut the fuck up, eh?""

Both Pete and Carl looked over at him, slightly shocked that they'd been interrupted. Even Gary seemed vaguely surprised that he'd intervened where he usually didn't feel the need.

""I'm so effing sick of it! You two should really sort your shit out right about now, or else I'm out!""

With that, John stormed off towards the dressing rooms at the end of the hallway, leaving his stunned bandmates standing in the corridor staring after him.

""What the fuck was that?""

Gary sighed. ""I think that was a warning, mate.""

John slammed the dressing room door behind him as he stomped into the room. Throwing himself down in one of the chairs, he scowled darkly at the bare wall; which, he fancied, was probably asking itself what it had done to deserve such a glare.

He sighed wearily; he was worrying about a wall's feelings, and was on the verge of comforting it and assuring it that it wasn't at fault.

He decided he had to get out of there. Not just for his sanity's sake, but because the others would be coming back soon, and he didn't want to be asked what was ""bothering"" him, or, worse, have to deal with more of Pete and Carl's bickering. Grabbing one of their rejected setlist drafts from the floor, he nabbed the pen out of Pete's journal and scrawled a quick note telling them he'd headed out for a walk and not to worry, he'd get back to the hotel fine.

Spotting a roll of gaffa tape on the floor, he broke some off and went to tape the note to the wall he'd been musing over earlier. However, as he went to stick it down, his hand, curiously enough, went through the wall.

""Well, you're just full of secrets, aren't you my frien -""

John was cut off by a force behind the wall yanking the rest of his body forward to join his hand on the other side of the so-called ""wall"".

John looked around him curiously. After a dizzying fall through some sort of technicolour tunnel, he'd found himself in a room that looked remarkably like the one he'd just been pulled from. Same shape, same positioning of the door, very similar furniture…In fact, the only differences were the way the room looked slightly less worn, and the fact that none of their gear was in here. There was still an array of drink and drugs laid out on the table in the corner, but someone else's clothing and personal effects were scattered over the chairs and floor. A glittering catsuit that John was sure none of them would try to pull off (Note: I really want to change this to something else, but I'm not sure how to put it) Platform boots in a rather bizarre orange leather. And a collection of make up that covered the dressing table, mingled with the traces of cocaine obviously left by its owner when they left the room hurriedly.

Someone was coming. John could hear stumbling footfalls and hushed laughter from the corridor outside. Panicked, he stared wildly around the room, hoping for somewhere, anywhere to hide. Spotting a cupboard in one corner, he dashed over to it and dived in amongst a collection of disused stage costumes that smelt like theatre: make up, a little bit of sweat and, overpoweringly, must from being left in the cupboard a little too long. He carefully pulled the door closed behind him, but for curiosity's sake, left a tiny gap to peer through. Maybe the mysterious owner of the dressing room could shed some light on what the hell was going on here.

His dash into the depths of the cupboard was not a second too late, for the next moment the door burst open, and two figures fell through it, entangled in each other, before slamming it closed behind them. One of the figures had a hood of some sort over his hair, and his back to John, so was therefore unidentifiable, but the other, with vivid orange hair spiked up above his head with hairspray...

John bit back a gasp. David Bowie?? He was in David Bowie's dressing room?

But hang on, why was Bowie in his Aladdin Sane getup? Everyone knew he was a more serious, adult artist these days, what was going on there?

John realised this probably wasn't his main worry right now, when Bowie and his unidentified companion began kissing each other again, deeply. John flinched slightly, seeing where this was probably heading all too clearly, and not wanting to have to witness it.

""Mmph..."" They broke off the kiss for a moment, and stood panting for a moment, still close together.",1,en,1

"Sex Worker Voices

Eris Martinet is a professional dominatrix with years of experience. She blogs on issues of female domination, BDSM and the History of Kink. You can follow her at @ErisMartinet

Sex work is legal work. We all have to work to survive, it’s not a fancy, it’s because we like to live. Extravagant, I know. You CAN afford not to work, if you’re, like, born super wealthy; like the royals. But then, you have to pretend you’re earning your riches, and that’s work.

The thing is, we’re all put on this planet competing for resources and we have to work exponentially harder to survive despite the economy being so great it transformed the earth, you wonder where’s it all going to? And some, the wage people, now until their 70s? But I digress. The idea is one type of work or another is a choice between various types of compromises and unfair deals capitalism cuts you. I assume the upper class doesn’t read sex worker articles so I’m addressing the middle and lower class. It’s all coercive, in the larger frame. You may choose to labour in a bar, develop tendonitis for 6 pounds an hour, feel that leaves you wholesome and noble, even though the grinning lined up men at the bar tipping you every time they catch a glimpse of your bosom as you stretch for the top shelf whiskey — IS sex work, you’re just not paid sex worker money. I choose a form of sex work that makes me feel great. I choose higher pay per hour, being my own employer, and having men kiss my feet for 3/4 figures, and building my own image and brand, and deciding who I talk to and who I graciously shun.

​You say this is “prostitution”, and “whoredom”, and innately evil in ways that are so hard to detect they surely belong in the mythical realm. I acknowledge the accompanying stigmatizing factors that come with it. I just don’t care. You choose to labour in a strict hierarchy earning your crumbs and sitting in a cubicle 8 hours a day with 10 min lunch break, pretending to really like selling roof solutions; but you have the accompanying “respectability” of being a sales agent…I choose the comfort, beauty, and elation that come from femdom, …and the occasional combination of sounds that reach my inner ear that attempt to shame me: “whore”. Waves in the air. Life in a cage. Comfort and relative independence, free time, respect, beauty…versus rules, hollow tasks, order from above, and low wages. Yeah, I’ll choose sex work, thank you very much.

Sex work is manifold. It can mean direct sexual intercourse with bells and whistles, and it can mean tweeting a dollar emoji to your fanbase to receive direct cash transfers. It can mean high end artistic and gymnastic skill of a stripper, it can mean the aristocracy of sex work, Dita von Teese, rubbing shoulders with Hollywood. It can mean Jessy, teenage heroin addicted sex worker, risking her life every night, victim of ill circumstance, a girl who braves her destiny and doesn’t blame anyone. Why don’t we help her? If you, social justice warrior of the keyboard variety, really wanted to help sex workers, then you’d stop trying to “save” the sex worker millionaires and go and help this poor little girl who has no one. Go. Go now, and help her. Get in touch with the journalist, here is his Twitter, and find out how to donate money for her to exit the streets, get shelter, education and medical assistance to stop the addiction that fuels the need for low paid, high risk sex work. And stop trying to rescue me, from my lavish Edwardian furniture, beating the shit out of men with a gilded crop for more than your month’s salary. Pathetic.

Politicians are helping the wrong people. They’re interested in war and that when they’ve got kids sleeping in train stations.— Jessy, a really lovable girl with plenty of bad luck.

Moreover, why the firm boundaries? Since I own sexual features that make me desirable to men, whether I am willing or not, I get sexually objectified. You as a honest woman are prevented by “words” and “respectability” from turning what is basically a sexual asymmetry remnant of evolutionary pasts, into hard cash. I am not beholden to fictions, like God, or “reputation”. When a dude hits up my vanilla professional profile without a single sexy pic, but a professional business headshot, and asks “how u doin’ babe”, I won’t recoil in horror anymore; I’m sending him an invoice. That’s what men would do. But men, also, historically, trained women to NOT do that. So that they belong to the tribe, body and soul. Uterus and clitoris. Mind and matter.",1,en,1

Having intimate knowledge of your country’s legal system enables you to make impacts you simply couldn’t from the outside.

My goals as a feminist are simple. I want to throw out every last 3rd wave, sex shaming, man hating person involved in my movement. Feminism by definition lends itself to misandry but it needn't be this way. Many women before me actively tried to eradicate that idea with the career woman movement in the 1980's, the idea that men also suffer from societal pressure just like women (Susan Bordo’s excellent study entitled Reading the Male Body), and many early adapters that wanted to push the idea of suffrage without dumping all over their male counterparts. They wanted actual equality through laws and society. Please refer to women like C.H. Sommers or Cathy Young for an idea.

In the opposite direction, the 3rd wave of feminism (as exemplified by damsels in distress like Anita Sarkeesian et al) are in the business of ensuring that not only do women get their comeuppance, but they take down men in the process. They have their vintage counterparts in the 2nd wave, where the patriarchy = oppression idea was born. This wave of feminism also gave us gems like all penetrative sex is rape etc. This is not the club I signed up for. So how do I define feminism?

Simply put, it is empowerment through choice. The choices made available to someone are as important as the decision they make. What good is “freedom” if you only have one choice in election (see North Korea)? So for me feminism = choice. If you choose to be a porn actress, great. Would you prefer to perhaps be a housewife? Great. A career woman with no kids? Great. All of these are valid and important choices. That’s what has me most upset with the 3rd wave & their ilk. Frankly, they’re mainly white, mainly men, and mainly prude as all get out. Which again, is fine if you make your choice and leave others to it.

Of course, that isn't what happens. They attempt to make your choices for you, or eliminate what choices you can make. Are you a woman that believes GTAV isn't the hate filled piece of misogyny certain “journalists” tell you it is? Too bad, we've gotta get it pulled. We know better than you do that its poison for your mind, little pretty. Your internalized misogyny is killing you and Dr. McIntosh has the fix. Just ban it. Or guilt game developers into never making games like it. Or call women/PoCs that voice their opinions through channels like the NotYourShield hashtag “sockpuppets” etc. Seems super inclusive and positive right? Why in the world would modern women care to call themselves feminists when all you offer is sex-shaming, kink-shaming, and man hate? The fact is, women in the Western world have it better than ever before. In many regards women have the advantage.

Take a look at the insanity of rape shield laws in this country (I recommend Cathy Young’s piece on rape shield laws located here) or custody/divorce law. The pendulum has swung too far in the other direction in some arenas. The fact is, misogyny as defined by radfem culture on Tumblr has turned all men into scared, hand wringing white knights. In my humble opinion, paternalism is far more offensive than strippers being killed in a video game. Period. Treating women & minorities like children isn’t helping. Why do women allow such nonsense anyway? My answer is overly simplified for this essay. I believe the true issue with women in today’s society is “Princess Culture.”

What *is* Princess Culture? Its the pervasive notion that women are all special beautiful creatures. We’re really really not. Some of us are loathsome. Some of us are indeed awesome. The idea that we all deserve fairy tales, should be treated with kid gloves, and can’t be wrong, is just as damaging to women as a whole than anything men are doing. Evidence of this issue can be seen on Tumblr in spades with the creation of terms like “head-mates” “privilege” and so much more. Its scary to think that you are just a person. Just a woman. Just a speck on a planet. In order to combat those feelings, they create things to become indignant about. My pronouns are xir, my headmate is a wolf, I deserve a big shiny wedding ring because I’m special and you’re lucky to have gotten me.

Dealing with people that behave as if they’re special in some way is awful enough when they’re 15. Speaking to the radical feminism set on Twitter that become enraged at Chan style humor when they’re 30 is depressing. Being offended is something princesses get to shout “Off with their heads!” about. Someone needs to pay for my feelings being hurt. Whether I get you fired, destroy your marriage with false sexual harassment claims, or run you from your home (see the Communismkills scandal on Tumblr) you *deserved* it, because you dared to cross your majesty. You’d better learn to curtsy.

They’re all representative of personal dictatorships, killing and silencing those who disagree or call the Queen out. Unfortunately, they tried to do this within the context of gaming. All of a sudden, the Princesses of Tumblr etc were encountering guys saying “Tits or GTFO” or men that were Anon and therefore, not guaranteed to be men. Its hard to disregard someone’s opinion based on gender or being cis when you don’t know what the fuck they are. Princesses don’t like being told no. Princesses don’t like being called out for being genuinely shitty people (not women, PEOPLE). Princesses also can’t comprehend that gamers don’t give a damn that they’re royalty in their own heads. Gamers have been dealing with women thinking they’re special since time immemorial.

How many “gamer grrls” started popping up once geek culture became cool? A lot. Some of them are certainly genuine and just want to play, but some of them are the same girls that take up watching football because their boyfriends like it. They’re “one of the guys.” In reality they’re anything but. Football is an apt comparison here. Look at the NFL, the supposed manliest institution of sport in America. Covered in pink, being led around like a puppy on a leash by special interest groups. What the extremists on the left didn't expect was the resounding “fuck no” heard from all across the internet when GamerGate started. Just look at the representation GamerGate has when compared to the 3rd wavers.

GamerGate has all races, all creeds, atheists, religious people, straight, gay, etc. What do they have? Mostly white dudes. White dudes are great by the way… White dudes telling women & minorities that we’re failing at being women & minorities are just racists/actual misogynists. Funny how that works.

GamerGate is the single group of people that has been unwilling to get on its knees to avoid the beheading. GamerGate is everything princesses fear, the dark fog creeping in to bring a change in regime. The radicals have had long enough with the megaphone, the platforms, the “righteousness” on behalf of their subjects. Clearly, people have had enough of the outrage army fighting on the Princesses’ behalf. In my anecdotal experience, GGers are some of the few people left in this society willing to laugh at themselves. They’re the most inclusive & intelligent people I've met en masse in my lifetime.

Here’s to hoping GamerGate succeeds in creating new media, new ideals, and knocking the Princesses down from the pedestal on which society has placed them.

    How the *&^% is that comic book store owner supposed to know how many people will come into his shop?   Sitting in his basement before hand and counting how many comics he has to sell does ZERO to increase sales. 

     The NUMBER ONE failing of small business owners I've seen (including myself) is the failure to network. Most entrepreneurs I know have VERY few actual leads for their business and know squat about selling.  Setting up a shop should come from the desires of the marketplace, not your desire to sell comic books.  An entrepreneur doesn't care about the product, only the process.  If you have an interest and want to make a living at it, thats another category.

"Crystal structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa N-acetyltransferase PA4534.
The GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily includes a large and diverse group of enzymes that catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A (Ac-CoA) to the amine group of a substrate. Substrates include protein N-terminus, lysine of histone tails, and other small molecules such as aminoglycoside, serotonin, and glucose-6-phosphate. GNAT superfamily of proteins is involved in many physiologically important reactions in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. However, functions of many GNATs remain unknown and PA4534 is one of those uncharacterized GNAT proteins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To investigate functions of the PA4534, we determined the apo and Ac-CoA bound PA4534 structures. Our structures showed that PA4534 shared common characteristic structures with other GNAT family N-acetyltransferases and contained a potential substrate binding tunnel close to the bound Ac-CoA.",0,en,0

The detection of cytokines in disease states promises to provide useful information for diagnostic purposes. The therapeutic utility of cytokines has been explored in many clinical and preclinical studies and in a wide variety of infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and neoplasias.

"Mechanisms by which resistant starches and non-starch polysaccharide sources affect the metabolism and disposition of the food carcinogen, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline.
Although both non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and resistant starches (RS) are included in current definitions of dietary fibre, our previous work has suggested fundamental differences in the way in which these two classes of material affect the disposition and absorption of a dietary carcinogen. The present studies explore whether different effects on carcinogen metabolism could play a role in the contrasting patterns seen previously. Groups of female Wistar rats were pre-fed for 4 weeks one of five types of defined diet (AIN-76). The control diet contained 35% maize starch and no dietary fibre. The RS-containing diets had all the maize starch substituted with either Hi-maize or potato starch. In the NSP-containing diets, 10% of the maize starch was substituted with dietary fibre in the form of either lignified plant cell walls (wheat straw) or soluble dietary fibre (apple pectin). Pre-fed rats were gavaged with the food carcinogen, [2-14C] 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), and plasma and urinary metabolites characterized using HPLC at various time intervals after administration. After 4 h gavage, plasma from rats on both RS-containing diets contained significantly higher levels of intact IQ and lower levels of the major metabolites, IQ-5-O-glucuronide and IQ-5-sulfate, as compared with plasma from the negative control group at this time. In contrast, plasma from animals on the NSP-containing wheat straw diet (and to a lesser extent the apple pectin diet) showed significantly lower levels of intact IQ, and significantly higher levels of the two major metabolites, as compared with those from the control rats. These different metabolite profiles were also reflected in different urinary excretion profiles. Urine from rats pre-fed RS-containing diets revealed significantly slower metabolite excretion as compared with urine from rats that had been given the NSP-containing diets. Western blotting methodologies also profiled differences between the effects of these two types of dietary fibre in the expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. We conclude that changes in activity and expression of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes could play a role in the contrasting effects of these two types of dietary fibre on carcinogen uptake and disposition.",0,en,0

"How to get a personal loan Colorado? Who can apply for a loan?

The basic thing to get a personal loan with a good rate is to meet certain requirements: to be between 18 and 65 years old, to reside in USA and not have the name denied in credit bureaus.

Low interest personal loans Colorado

You can take out a personal loan from your bank, financial institutions, Fintechs online or in cooperatives. The important thing to make this decision is to compare the interest rate that each offers, other benefits such as the type of document you need to send, how many days the money goes into your account and what happens if you want to anticipate or repay the loan. I’ve already decided to take out a personal loan. What are the care?

Where to get a Personal Loan in Colorado?

At your bank

Those who have a bank account usually have a pre-approved personal credit line. This means that the bank has done their credit analysis and has already released a limit that you can borrow at any time. The hiring can be done by internet banking, at the ATM or even by the mobile application. The advantage is the ease of hiring this money, but in return, the interest rate may not be the most appropriate to your profile. Just recommends that you always compare your rate before applying for any loan.

Finding your manager at the agency and asking for a simulation is also another way of trying a personal loan. Take advantage of face-to-face contact to clear all doubts and ask for details about the interest rate and all other costs. Thus, you must be informed about Total Effective Cost (CET), ie the final interest rate.

Payday Loans

Another option is to seek financial loans – companies that specialize in lending money, but which are not banks. Just like banks, a credit analysis will be done, but in those institutions, you do not have a pre-approved credit: therefore, you will be asked for some documents and information so that it can be decided how much the financier can lend you and what the rate of interest. Calm down on the interest rate that will be offered because it is common for financials to pay dearly for loans.

Secured personal loan Colorado

Hiring an online loan is an alternative that has been gaining ground in America. In general, this modality is offered by fintechs, financial services innovation companies, such as Just. These companies use technology to automate processes, and do not have physical points of sale. Thus, it is possible to offer cheaper interest rates. Fintechs act as banks and financial correspondents.

Even with the promise of lower interest rates, in this modality it is always interesting to carefully analyze the Total Effective Cost.

One of the advantages of borrowing online is the ease of doing simulations and comparing interest rates between different companies and also with your own bank. In order to obtain an offer, it is necessary to present, generally, proof of income, residence, bank move and income tax returns.

In some institutions the process is more bureaucratic. This is not the case with Just, where the process can be finalized in less than five minutes. On some sites, money is made available in just two business days. Understand how the loan works in Just.

Best personal loan rates Colorado

Another option for lower interest rates is to be associated with a credit union. It is a different model of what is practiced in traditional financial institutions because each customer is also a partner of the company. The interest rate is usually competitive, but the cooperatives also pose a risk to the consumer. It is important to note that profits or losses are shared among all members.

The hiring process is very simple: in 5 minutes you hire the loan that best fits your financial profile. But do not forget: It is important that your loan does not commit more than 20% of your monthly income!",0,en,0

Cell phone calls or VHF radio call outs in the middle of the open ocean aren't distress calls, they are a waste of precious battery power.    With today's technology, there is really no reason to operate like this.  It puts them and potential rescuers at needless risk.

Gay on Facebook: Nowhere to Hide - edw519
http://www.newsweek.com/2010/06/02/the-digital-closet.html

======
michael_dorfman
I think the article is missing the point.

It's not that you can't have a secret and be on Facebook-- it's that you can't
have anybody who knows your secret be on Facebook.

Put another way: even if ""Joe"" (from the article) were not on Facebook, that
wouldn't have stopped someone from posting a comment about his boyfriend.

People talk about other people. You can't control what they say. If these
people are publishing their comments (to their ""friends"", or on blogs, to the
general public), you're shit out of luck.

~~~
brown9-2
Furthermore, the example outlined in the opening could have just as easily
happened in an overheard real-life conversation rather than online.

 _Joe was upset with our friend for sending the tweet, the content of which
was a bit careless but totally benign, and my response to him was a
combination of devil’s advocacy and good old-fashioned tough love._

Joe's friend could have been just as careless (or ignorant about his sexuality
being a secret) by making a comment in front of people who were not aware of
the secret.

The issue isn't being online, or Facebook or Twitter - the issue is keeping a
secret.

edit: whoops, thenduks made the same exact argument I made here, but better

~~~
marcusbooster
It could be mitigated if Facebook offered real privacy controls, mainly
keeping our social circles separate from each other like we do in real life.
I'd like the option: if a member of network X posts on my wall, members from
network Y and Z should not be able to see it.

But that would require real privacy controls and it goes against Facebook's
absurd mission statement to open up the entire world (or whatever that
embroidery is inside that dopey hoodie).

------
tjmaxal
The idea that you can't really keep secrets on the internet shouldn't really
be news to anyone. Especially not here.

That being said, I think most people's privacy is kept because there just
aren't that many people interested in you in general. Unless you do something
to make yourself a target.

_Keeping an eagle eye on tagged photos_

This is one of the things that goes beyond Facebook as a platform and
technology and becomes a cultural issue. You can delete your Facebook account
or never get on Facebook in the first place, but that won't stop people from
publishing photos of you on it. I can't help feeling it has become socially
acceptable for your friends or even acquaintances to publish photos of you on
the Internet.

 _Facebook is now an integral part of our culture. Its precipitous growth is
owed to the fact that it works only if it’s massive. The more people
participate, the more utility it has, and the more utility it has, the more
compulsory participation becomes._

And _this_ is precisely why so many people are making a fuss about Facebook's
privacy policy and attitude towards privacy. Whether we all like it or not,
Facebook has become a part of our global culture and it influences the way we
think and behave. If part of its influence is to encourage you to stop caring
about your privacy -- or even to simply refrain from reminding you to take
care of it -- then we won't need to worry about anyone taking our privacy
away; we, the society, will give it up on our own.

I came to mention exactly this same sentence. Maybe it's just that I'm out of
the loop—but I'm 30, not a complete technological outsider, and I have never
used Facebook or felt any pressure to do so. In what sense is this
participation compulsory? I'd have liked to see some more elaboration on this
principle that seems often to be taken for granted.

(I'd particularly be interested to hear an argument that couldn't also have
been applied to AOL in the early '90's—I really did consider it vital to be
there to communicate with out-of-state friends without enormous phone bills,
but the notion nowadays of participation in AOL being compulsory is
laughable.)

~~~
CodeMage
It's not really compulsory in the sense that someone is making you
participate. It's simply the peer pressure. Here's some ""anecdata"" to
illustrate the point: I don't have a Facebook account anymore, but my wife
does. Anyone among my friends and family who wants to see my son's photos is
told to go to my wife's photo gallery. Sure, we could use Picasa or Flickr or
even e-mail, but she's already using Facebook and it's easier that way. So if
a friend or family member wants to see the photos and doesn't have a Facebook
account, they have an additional small incentive to get one.

Facebook has become one of those things everyone mentions now and then. You
can use it to keep in touch with high school friends (even those you didn't
like in the first place), to exchange gossip, to kill time (if you think
mindlessly watching TV is the worst you can do with your time, think again),
etc. If everyone around you uses it for something and mentions it often
enough, you'll feel left out of that. Those of us who can say ""well, I'm glad
to be left out of _that_ "" are a minority.

------
thenduks
I fail to see how a friend posting a comment exposing the relationship on
facebook is any different than that same friend making the same kind of
comment while out for drinks 'IRL'.

This has nothing to do with 'social media'.

~~~
raganwald
When someone comments while out for drinks, three people hear it. They may
tell a few people, and the word will get around within a circle of friends who
know each other.

It may never reach other circles of your friends. In my own case, the circle
of my FB friends that I know from technology do not overlap with the circle of
friends that I know from sports very much. Something could easily go around
one circle and not the other.

But FB merges them: Something on my wall is visible of all of my circles of
friends. That's what I took from the article: Social Media kicks down the
walls between circles of friends.

~~~
thenduks
Of course you are right: There is almost certainly going to be a difference in
the magnitude of a 'breach'.

I still think this is way out of proportion. Let's use the example of your two
circles. Assuming a few/some/most/all of your friends are in the same
geographical area, how common is it to run into people from group A while out
with group B (and thus open the possibility of group A people making comments
you don't want group B to hear)? I know for me situations like this are very
common. Just the other day I was leaving a restaurant with friends and ran
into other completely unrelated friends who were sitting on the patio.

I don't think that just because Facebook is an _easier_ way for your
clueless/inconsiderate friends to let stuff slip is Facebook's problem, is all
I'm saying. Facebook is just the highest profile, most widely used method of
having a persona online. That comes with upsides and downsides -- if you
aren't comfortable with the risks you can simply not partake.

------
psyklic
The article missed perhaps the easiest way to surmise if someone is gay on
Facebook -- mutual friends. If you both are gay, you probably have the same
gay mutual friends.

Ever since I started adding gay people, I started getting friend requests from
other random gay people (I'm assuming who use Facebook for dating).

------
Sam_Odio
This smacks of link bait & bandwagoning. The author's experience with Twitter
is contorted to support a statement about Facebook.

The FUD among the mainstream press is getting a little tiresome and distracts
from the real privacy issues on the site. Instead I'd prefer to see a concrete
discussion of exactly what controls/features are broken - that's much more
actionable on my end.

Disclaimer: I work for Facebook, but don't speak on their behalf.

~~~
meh2themeh
I think you just misunderstood the article. This isn't FUD, mostly because it
wasn't an attack on Facebook, not even slightly, and also is entirely true.

I am gay and have noticed exactly what the author is talking about with myself
and many others. I don't write anything ever on Facebook (sorry, it bores me
to tears, I don't hold Facebook use against anyone though :), but it is
completely obvious from my mutual friends, from the fact that my profile says
who my boyfriend is, etc, that I am gay.

It is a simple fact that Facebook (and other social networks to a lesser
extent), blur together social circles that otherwise never would have blended.
For example, both sides of my extended family in totally different areas of
the country friend me. These are people who I never bothered to formally come
out to (because we aren't in reality that close). Simply accepting their
invite is also an act of uncloseting. For someone who actually _is_ in the
closet, that degree of uncloseting is possibly very uncomfortable, and hard to
know if you are even doing it (is it obvious or not from my mutual friends
that I'm gay?). This absolutely is not a kind of thing that happened in the
pre-social network world.

But, this also is not, in any way, because of Facebook privacy problems or
controls or whatever. It is an inherent property of the kind of very
transparent, mixed ""all social circles are one social circle"" model that
Facebook (and other social network sites) have. Maybe other people don't
notice this as much because a lot of gay people (especially closeted gay
people) were more used to having extremely disjoint social groups which the
online world suddenly makes dramatically less disjoint.

Anyway, if you actually read the whole article, the author writes about this
as a positive thing, because it makes the closet much harder to choose, since
the traditional problem of policing your life to your closet door closed
becomes so much harder. The author interprets this in the end as being a
social positive since coming out is in a way a political and socially
influential act.

"Q:

Can particleboard subfloor be used as a nail base for 3/4"" solid wood strip flooring?

Question: Has anybody out there laid solid oak strip floor over a 3/4"" particle board subfloor and lived to tell about it? 
Basis for question: I did a search on SE and all answers point to pulling it up, block the walls if needed block the edges where the new will tie in, etc. All of that is proper and good, if I was doing this in an empty house, or even my house while I was living in it.
This will be done in my aunt and uncles house, both are well in their 70's and I will not disrupt their lives that this would require. I called the flooring manufacturer customer service, and I was told the engineered flooring could be stapled down but the solid 3/4"" could not. I guess wood movement or lack of it has something to do with it, but I could not quite put my finger on why one is good but not the other. So I asked the customer rep the same thing. The only response I got was, ask this of other installers out there that have done what you seek to do.
So here I am, I know it is frowned upon, but nobody has said in the forums it has failed, only that it is not good to do and the subfloor needs to be replaced. So as an extension of the question is, has anybody installed solid wood floor over a particle board subfloor and it failed, even in the slightest? I do understand that if the floor gets wet there will be problems. The house was built in the 60's and the floor is still solid everywhere I checked, there are vents in the floor I removed to inspect under the carpet the amount I could lift up the carpet to look under where I could.

A:

I have seen it fail.  I have momentarily tried it.  And I will never waste my time again.  
Fail
Went through a potential house 8-9 years ago.  Mid 60s house.  They just put down hardwood to sell it.  A floor that had just been laid a few weeks earlier had shifting in at least two areas.  I popped off a piece of trim in a closet.  Pointed flashlight down, stuck screwdriver in and broke off a piece of particle board.  I ended up talking them down 15K on the house because of the issue which I reminded them they would now have to disclose.  
Two workers and myself had all of the wood popped up (1000 sq feet worth) in about 3-4 hours.  I was using a putty knife in some places.  The staples didn't hold - and they were long.  We took the particle board out and threw down plywood...  Probably the most tedious task was pulling the staples and numbering the planks.  We got 15K for 2 days of work.
I tried it....
A couple years previous to this I pulled up carpet out of a house (lush wool from the 70s that was past its time).  I had a few hundred feet of leftovers from a previous house so what the hell... In my third row I was push my first row over... I stopped and retreated.

Particle board was used a lot in my area in the 60-70s for carpet.  I can see it working for anything else.  Hell I am not even sure how it lasts 40 years in some houses.  When you pull it up you can see it swollen in some areas.  Even when screw down it pops right up.  Nothing sticks in it (don't get me started on glued down particle board which is a disaster to demo).  
Take a couple planks.  Staple them down  and watch how fast they move.  
I think you have some options... Go back to carpet.  Go to a floating floor and make sure you have a really good underlayment (semi-waterproof).  Or take out particle board and replace with plywood.  If you are by yourself on the job it could take a while but with a couple of helpers it could be a one day (long day) project.  OSB is a subfloor that I would really be wishy-washy on installing hardwoods (never in my house) but particle board is never a thought to me.

"1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to a digital camera which converts light from an object to be photographed, into digital data, and stores the digital data.
The present application is based on Japanese Patent Application Nos. Hei. 11-105277, Hei. 11-105285, Hei. 11-105124, and 2000-90663, which are incorporated herein by reference.
2. Description of the Related Art
There is known a digital camera which converts light into an electric signal by an optical sensor, such as a CCD or the like and further converts the electric signal into digital data so as to be stored in a storage medium, such as a flash memory or the like. The digital camera permits saving of image data and a variety of processes to easily and personally be performed by using a personal computer or the like. Moreover, a photograph can be printed by outputting image data to a printer without a necessity for performing development of a film. Since the print quality of the printer has been improved, a photograph having excellent quality which cannot substantially be distinguished from a film photograph can be printed.
It is preferable that the digital camera has a multiplicity of functions to permit a user to set a multiplicity of required items. To enable the user to quickly change the setting, a multiplicity of input device, such as buttons etc., must be provided. In the foregoing case, assignment of the functions to the buttons cannot easily be understood by the user. Since the size of each button is undesirably reduced, there arises a problem in that the button cannot easily be depressed.
It might be feasible to employ a structure for reducing the number of buttons such that a menu screen is displayed on a display unit, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) unit, to permit a process which must be executed to be selected in accordance with combination of the selected button and a decision button. In the foregoing case, there arises another problem in that the required operation becomes too complicated and an excessively long time is required.
When the menu screen is displayed on the display portion to select a process which must be executed in accordance with the combination of the selected button and the decision button, there is apprehension that the finger of the user undesirably covers the display portion when the button is operated. Therefore, the operation for causing the finger to approach the display portion and move away from the display must be repeated. Thus, there arises a problem in that the operability deteriorates.",0,en,0

Russell was active in the Fabian socialist movement.  His political thought was certainly very sympathetic to many technocratic ideas, but was generally more abstract than any ideology.  Roads to Freedom makes patent his political promiscuity: Russell was willing to support any movement that would tend to push history towards human freedom, humane social relations, and the rational satisfaction of human needs.  (Although when nuclear war was concerned, he seemed to prefer social injustice to complete ruin).  On the other hand, Russell was deeply skeptical of technology and science in its influence on human society and culture.  The Scientific Outlook was his vision of a scientific dystopia—one which incorporates much of technocracy.  (For the uninitiated: it is somewhat similar to Brave New World).  Although the technocratic elements are not necessarily portrayed in a negative light, they are not left blameless for the resulting society.  All in all, it seems hard to imagine that book could be the work of an enthusiastic technocrat. — 06:39, 27 January 2007",0,en,0

"That’s been quite out of character for both men. When Cruz arrived in Washington last year, it was assumed he would bring a moderating influence to the Tea Party, or at least serve as a bridge between it and the GOP establishment. Yes, he had run an insurgent campaign in Texas’s Republican primary—beating the establishment choice, poor old David Dewhurst—but, prior to that run, Cruz had spent years comfortably working within that establishment, from his college days at Princeton to Harvard Law School to a Supreme Court clerkship to the Bush administration to the Supreme Court bar. His CV revealed a man who possessed an impressive skill for navigating powerful institutions and, not unrelatedly, ingratiating himself to institutional power. He’d seek out one mentor who’d then introduce him to a new one. Chuck Cooper, the eminent conservative lawyer whose firm once employed a young Cruz, once recalled to me, “Ted had clerked for Rehnquist and I had as well, and before that he’d clerked for Mike Luttig, who’s a very close friend of mine, so it was through them that Ted really came to my attention.” In other words, Cruz had climbed the greasy pole through his relationships.

But since Cruz has gotten to the Senate, he’s done a complete 180. Far from trying to work within the institution and suck up to power, he’s sought to blow up the former and piss off the latter—whether it was his fight over Obamacare that resulted in a government shutdown last fall or, just last month, his use of a procedural maneuver that essentially forced the Senate Republican leadership to vote for a “clean” debt-ceiling increase. Meanwhile, despite the fact that Cruz is the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s vice chairman for grassroots outreach, he’s refused to endorse his Senate colleagues Mitch McConnell, Pat Roberts, and Thad Cochran in their primary fights. In general, Cruz has appeared to go out of his way to tick off the powers that be in the most petty, pointless, and personal manner possible. “They don’t keep Senate records about this kind of thing,” John Dickerson wrote last fall, “but it’s likely that no senator has created as many enemies in his party in as short a time as the junior senator from Texas.”

In other words,Cruz is behaving the way everyone assumed Rand Paul would. Before Paul arrived in the Senate in 2011, he’d spent much of his life being a pain in the ass. As a college student at Baylor who loved to tweak the conservative (and religiously devout) administration; as an ophthalmologist who founded a renegade ophthalmological organization to protest the certification rules of the medical specialty’s long-established professional group; as an insurgent Tea Party candidate who ran against the Kentucky GOP establishment’s (and Mitch McConnell’s) handpicked candidate, Paul was a man who thumbed his nose at institutions and institutional power.

And yet, in the Senate, he’s tried to be a team player—especially when it’s come to his relationship with his fellow Kentucky Senator and Republican leader McConnell, the man he was implicitly running against back in 2010. Before launching his drone filibuster last year, Paul made sure to clear the move with McConnell. Later, he provided McConnell some crucial Tea Party cover back home in Kentucky by not joining Cruz in his shutdown crusade. And, while Cruz has shirked his NRSC duties, Paul, according to an NRSC staffer, routinely shows up to make his fundraising calls for the group; more importantly, he has endorsed McConnell in his primary fight back in Kentucky (albeit maybe not always as wholeheartedly as he could have). All of which has endeared—or, if not endeared, at least made Paul tolerable—to large and unexpected swaths of the GOP establishment. When Mitt Romney hosted a political confab in Park City, Utah, last year, Paul was in attendance. (Cruz was not.) And Paul’s efforts to play nice have even made some of his policy views more palatable to the GOP establishment. Just consider how sentencing reform has become an issue an increasing number of Republicans now embrace.",1,en,1

"PROgression: Alejandro Fernandez to Join GRC Lites in 2014

Share this story:

After two successful years in karting, Colombian native Alejandro Fernandez will take the next step in his racing career in 2014. He will move up to the GRC Lites class of Red Bull Global Rallycross, driving the #126 GRC Lites car for Olsbergs MSE.

“I’m extremely excited to compete in the Lites series because of what GRC has to offer,” said Fernandez. “I like the competitiveness, how it’s a spec series and how that really puts an emphasis on the driver and not so much on the car. The ability to be able to travel to all the venues GRC will be attending this year is an extremely surreal feeling for me, as it is my first year out of karting.”

Fernandez, a native of Bogota, was born on January 26, 1996. After racing in BMX events for many years, he switched to karting in 2012 and quickly became a competitive racer in the Superkarts! USA ProTour, Challenge of the Americas, and won the 2013 IKF PRD Senior championship.

In only two short years, Fernandez has become one of the top drivers on the Buddy Rice Karting team. “I have, for the past two years, worked with Alejandro in building his skills and ability in racing,” said Rice, the 2004 Indianapolis 500 champion. “While our involvement was in the motorsports area I can say I saw true sportsmanship displayed. In addition to his conduct I witnessed a determination to obtain excellence in all his endeavors. His respect and regard for other participants was truly outstanding as well. Alejandro is confident, diligent, and intelligent.”

“I’ve gotten to know Alejo, and he’s a good kid,” said OMSE’s Brad Manka. “I’m pretty excited for the opportunity to watch him graduate from karts to cars, and to do it with GRC Lites in particular.”

Further details on Fernandez’s GRC Lites program will be released in the near future. For more information go to afracing126.com",0,en,0

The second element of the video is more interesting. Austen Fletcher asks the people of West Hollywood if they heard about President Trump calling MS-13 members “animals” and the reaction of some is outrage.

A man in a green sweater said of Trump’s MS-13 comments, “I think he’s criticizing his own American people.”

A second man turned the accusation around on President Trump, “What can you say about this guy. He’s the animal.”

“Would you agree that not all MS-13 members are animals?” Fletcher asked.

“Absolutely,” the man replied. He then clarified, “The guys that [are] running around gang-banging, killing people, they’re animals, you know. But the rest of the gang—it’s a big gang.”

Back when President Trump said there were “very fine people” on both sides of the tiki torch parade in Charlottesville, I was one of the people who said this was garbage. People giving Nazi salutes and chanting about Jews are not fine people. To hell with those racist creeps. They are both dumb and dangerous, which is a bad combination. I wish the President had called them “animals.”

These people on the street in far-left West Hollywood are probably still outraged about Trump’s comments on Charlottesville and yet here they are making the same mistake. MS-13 is one of the vilest, most violent gangs on earth. Their motto is “kill, rape, control” and that’s exactly what they do, including here in America. Let me once again quote the lede from this Washington Post story published last November:

As many as 10 members of the MS-13 street gang lured a man into a park in Wheaton, Md., spoke with one another over walkie-talkies as he arrived, stabbed him more than 100 times, decapitated him and then cut out his heart, according to police documents made public Wednesday in Montgomery County District Court.

That’s just one example of many. So it’s pretty amazing to see members of the resistance (not to mention various left-wing activists and reporters) leap to defend the common humanity of these ruthless killers. Why would they do that?

It’s the same reason West Hollywood is giving a porn star who (willingly) slept with a married man the key to the city: They hate Donald Trump. They hate him so much that it’s not enough to point out when he’s wrong, they have to attack him even when he’s right. If that means defending the honor of murderous MS-13 members, they’ll do that. They hate Trump so much that the irony of it won’t even hit them.

Here’s the clip. The section dealing with MS-13 is toward the middle.",1,en,1

"There's certainly some validity to that too.  But SS is more of an in-between program that's not nearly as bad.  While PERA has been an overly generous benefit (and thus very costly), SS remains a rather modest benefit - almost a safety net type of benefit.  It's more of a baseline amount to live a very barebones lifestyle if not supplemented.  Anything beyond that is up to the individual to save up for themselves (personally and/or through a job benefit).  And just as importantly, SS (usually) doesn't start paying benefits at a very early age.  Benefits starting years early is often more costly than a big benefit amount is.  Some retirees on PERA are getting a high% benefit as early as their mid-50's which is extremely costly.  Thankfully they've tightened that up in recent years to something closer to being sustainable, but for years it was way too generous (and costly).",0,en,0

"Medical efforts to treat pain, known as “pain management”, address a large market, as clinical pain is a worldwide problem with serious health and economic consequences. For example, in the United States, medical economists estimate that the effects of pain result in approximately $100 billion (USD) in costs annually, including an estimated $515 million (USD) in lost work days. According to the National Institute of Health, approximately 40 million Americans are unable to find relief from their pain. This includes approximately one million cancer patients that suffer from severe pain at any given time, and an estimated 10% of the more than 200,000 AIDS patients that suffer severe pain.
Drugs are a key element in the treatment of pain. The worldwide market for pain was about $40.7 billion in 2004. The pain management market has grown immensely in recent years and is expected to continue to grow significantly. The pain management market has grown by more than 34% per year during the past five years. This is likely due to a number of factors, such as, a rapidly aging population, patient demand for rapid effective pain relief, increasing recognition of the therapeutic and economic benefits of rapid and effective pain management by physicians, healthcare providers and payers, and longer survival times for patients with painful chronic conditions, such as cancer and AIDS.
Many different kinds of pain exist including acute, chronic, persistent and breakthrough pain. As well, there exist different approaches to treat pain. Opioids are typically prescribed to manage moderate-to-severe acute or chronic breakthrough pain due to the fact that fast-acting, short-lived opioids can provide rapid delivery. The most common acute use of opioids is for post-surgical pain. Opioid drugs used to treat acute pain include intravenous fentanyl, hydrocodone and oral oxycodone, which provide rapid pain relief. Intravenous therapy, however, is expensive and is suitable for hospitalized patients only.
The route of administration of any medication is an important consideration. Although many patients prefer oral administration of medications, oral medication is not always “fast-acting”, a property which is clearly desirable in the treatment of acute breakthrough pain, for example. Also, orally administrable medications are generally provided in the form of solid shaped articles such as tablets, pills, caplets and capsules that retain their shape under moderate pressure. Some patients, particularly pediatric and geriatric patients, have difficulty administering an oral medication due to inability to swallow, nausea or other gastrointestinal problems. Breakthrough pain medications can be taken in other ways, including by injection, under the tongue (sublingual), rectally, or transmucosally absorbed in the mouth but not swallowed; however, these forms of administration are often not as “fast-acting” as would be desired.
Liquid, syrups or suspensions are an alternative to solid dosage forms and are often preferred for pediatric and geriatric patients who have problems swallowing tablets. However, these dosage forms can be difficult to measure accurately and administer easily. Liquid formulations often deteriorate rapidly upon exposure to heat or other atmospheric conditions and consequently have a relatively short shelf life. Furthermore, liquid formulations require a relatively large volume and are bulky to store.
The bitter after-taste of many drugs which are orally administered, such as tablets, capsules or suspensions, often contributes to patient non-compliance in taking medicine. Apart from the taste of a chewable nutritional supplement, the ‘mouth-feel’ of the supplement must also be taken into account. ‘Mouth-feel’ is a concept that encompasses non-taste-related aspects of the sensation experienced by a person while chewing or swallowing a nutritional supplement. Aspects of mouth-feel include, for example, the hardness and brittleness of a composition, whether the composition is chewy, gritty, oily, creamy, watery, sticky, easily dissolved, astringent, effervescent, and the like, and the size, shape, and form (tablet, powder, gel, etc.) of the composition.
In view of the foregoing, there remains a need to develop a formulation for the oral delivery of a pharmaceutical agent that overcomes at least one of the disadvantages of prior formulations.",0,en,0

"Q:

MVC Kendo grid date validations giving error?

The field DateTime must be a date.

I am using Kendo grid in MVC project. I have both French and English version of the same application. The following is what I do in the _Layout.cshtml file:
<script>
    if (""@Session[""Culture""]"" === ""en-CA"") {
        kendo.culture(""en-US"");
        Globalize.culture('en-CA');
    } else {
        kendo.culture(""fr-CA"");
        Globalize.culture('fr-CA');
    }

    $.validator.methods.number = function (value, element) {
        return this.optional(element) || !isNaN(Globalize.parseFloat(value));
    }

    $.validator.methods.date = function (value, element) {          
        if (this.optional(element))
            return true;

        var result = Globalize.parseDate(value, ""@LCL.Common_Formats.DatePickerFormat"", ""@Session[""Culture""]"");

        return !isNaN(result) && (result != null);
    }

    $.validator.methods.min = function (value, element, param) {
        return this.optional(element) || Globalize.parseFloat(value) >= param;
    }

    $.validator.methods.max = function (value, element, param) {
        return this.optional(element) || Globalize.parseFloat(value) <= param;
    }

    $.validator.methods.range = function (value, element, param) {
        if (this.optional(element))
            return true;
        var result = Globalize.parseFloat(value);
        return (result >= param[0] && result <= param[1]);
    }
</script>

In the grid I have a datepicker as below:
 c.Bound(u => u.DateTime)
                    .Title(LCL.Common_Labels.PurchaseDate)
                    .Format(""{0:"" + LCL.Common_Formats.DatePickerFormat + ""}"")                    
                    .Width(smlColumn);

LCL.Common_Formats.DatePickerFormat is an entry in the Resources file for storing the datepicker formats. I have both English and French Resource files. My problem is that I am getting this weird exception:
The field DateTime must be a date 
when editing the record in the French version.

But it works very well in the English version...

A:

I found the best solution for this:
var culture = kendo.culture();
if (culture.name === ""fr-CA"")
{
    culture.calendar.patterns.F = ""dd/MM/yyyy"";
}
else
{
    culture.calendar.patterns.F = ""MM/dd/yyyy"";
}

This has to be added at the document.ready() section.
I spend 3 days to find the solution for this...

Unlike many of his fellow Hollywood stars, James Woods is an outspoken conservative, and frequently uses social media to spread his views.

In September, the actor was temporarily locked out of Twitter for posting a humorous meme two months before about men staying home on election day so women’s votes would count more.

“Pretty scary that there is a distinct possibility this could be real. Not likely, but in this day and age of absolute liberal insanity, it is at least possible…” he said when posting it.

The Casino actor called out Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey for the lockout, saying, “You are a coward, @jack. There is no free speech for Conservatives on @Twitter.”

“The irony is, Twitter accused me of affecting the political process, when in fact, their banning of me is the truly egregious interference,” the 71-year-old said.

"Resist the Undertow of Who You Are NOT

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines an undertow as follows: “an underlying current, force, or tendency that is in opposition to what is apparent,” and then again as, “a current in the sea or ocean that is below the surface and that moves away from the shore.” Generally speaking, both of these describe a movement away from what is desired.

A force in opposition to what is apparent is essentially one that encompasses deceit. And a current moving away from shore is certainly not a desired position in which to be caught.

In my own life, I think I’ve come to discover that these currents and forces are often presented to us. What’s more, I believe we are offered the chance to either wade into them, or deny their access. Choosing the first option usually costs me, and I’m only just now beginning to understand that the second one exists. The law of entropy (2nd law of thermodynamics) states that systems and processes left to themselves do not tend toward a state of increased orderliness; rather, they naturally gravitate toward a state of disorderliness and chaos. Similarly, I believe that life has a way of slowly and subtly pulling you under. If left unchecked, you may very well suddenly find yourself in an unhealthy place. What’s concerning, though, is that I’ll bet that when you look back at how you got there, you’ll probably discover that you said “yes” to things that were initially good. In fact, you probably said yes before you consulted your values (or were even aware that you had them!).

I’ll get more detailed, but let me make a few important distinctions. First, I’m not suggesting a life of selfishness. Seek the good of others, but know that you’re no good to others if you’re not also careful to seek your own fulfillment. Second, I’m not implying that one should avoid new challenges. “Not to dare is to lose oneself.” I agree wholeheartedly with Kiergerguard. Seek disruptions that edify, avoid distractions that erode. Lastly, sometimes the only way out of an undertow is to ride it out. That’s true of being caught in a literal ocean undertow. Should you find yourself being swept away from the shore, the worst thing you could do is fight like hell against it. Rather, you’re told to stay afloat and let the current take you out to where it runs out of steam; you’ll then be better able to swim parallel to shore before returning to its safety. Ride it out. Like that job that you hate but its paying for the Ph.D. that’s going to afford you a life more true to your calling and your values.

Resist the undertow of who you are NOT. The last four years of my life have been something of a crucible. Nothing hugely dramatic, but then crucibles and their processes rarely are. Oddly enough, my college and university degrees are in science. I’ve logged loads of undergraduate hours in chemistry, and we often utilized crucibles in the adjoining lab exercises. Despite what the process is accomplishing, it’s actually fairly underwhelming. For those not familiar with this content, I’ll be brief: basically the impurities of a metal mixture are separated in a small, heated bowl. That’s about it. Now to be fair, we’re talking about a substance that is subjected to very intense heat, which results in that substance being torn asunder, if you will. BUT, actually watching that take place through the frames of greasy lab goggles is super boring:)

Crucibles of life can be subtle and even difficult to spot. For example, in the last 4 years we’ve welcomed our two beautiful little girls into this world. Huge blessing! They’re both remarkable little ladies and we love them dearly! But after 5 years of marriage without kids, 2 in 3 years was a big life change for us. So just keep that in mind: the person sitting right next to you looking like they’ve got it all together may very well be giving it all they’ve got just to keep it together.

Over the last 4 years I’ve become increasingly aware of who I am, and thus better able to identify that which edifies and that which erodes, endeavors that keep me closer to the shoreline of my values and those which I’ve learned will work to pull me away from it. The crucible started to separate the two into startling clarity, and yet I stubbornly held onto everything, ignoring the erosion until finally my foundation began to crumble underneath. I like to NOT think of myself as an idiot, so I’ll clarify here that the reason I hesitated to remove the “impurities” is that they were generally good, and thus it took me a very long time to acknowledge them as a source of erosion. For example, I fronted a local band for a long time, writing and recording music and playing shows. Sounds fun, right? And it was! But it was wearing me out. At first, like probably every other example I could cite, I turned inward and assumed I was the problem. Then I realized all that this venture was requiring of me: booking shows, paying studio time, organizing rehearsals, (and then REorganizing cancelled rehearsals), building the website, and essentially acting as publicist, manager, agent and babysitter. Now LOTS of indie musicians and bands have to do that, so big-deal-boo-hoo. But the scale of edification and erosion began to tip in the wrong direction and I knew it was time for me to push pause. In general, am I a better husband, father, and friend now that music isn’t a part of my life? No. But am I better now for pushing pause on what that particular expression had devolved into? Immensely so. I’m certain music will be a part of my life again, but it’ll have to be in a way that edifies.

And that’s just one example. I could list a half dozen easily.

So There You Jolly Well Flippin' Well Blinkin' Well Go

My mind is a strange, strange place. F'rinstance, while walking Ziggy the other day I had a peculiar thought about different types of swearing and the effect it would have on young children. Children who are at an age where they know some things but not most things (though we are always at that age really). There's plain swearing like; shit, f**k, bastard, c**t (that's the order my ma likes to use). Then there's the more colourful style of swearing and this is where it might get confusing for kids. For example, 'Bloody Hell' might seem more tame than 'F**k's Sake' but imagine the visual image it can conjure up for a child. Firey pits of hell, with people screaming and blood EVERYWHERE. Some people like to say 'Holy F**k!' This is confusing and misleading to a child who knows that 'f**k' is a bad word but 'holy' is a good word. Of course, if a child is brought up without those religious connotations then swearing would just be swearing. Plain old swearing. Which I'm not condoning by the way.

Anyway, the thought that lead to those other thoughts was of my mum, who likes to say, 'So there you jolly' well, flippin' well, blinkin' well go' and it made me smile. And there ya go!

I do try and avoid swearing if I can although doing DIY makes me swear a lot even though I'm OK at doing it (thats good at DIY not the swearing).

But the COST of have that bum in that seat is roughly the same for both students!  The only difference is that the Canadian student's seat is subsidized through grants from the province (i.e., our taxes).

"I mean seriously have you spent 5 minutes talking to these kids lately?

"If a school district is facing low enough enrollment that it can no longer maintain two schools, one public and one separate, the FIRST school to be shut down should be the separate school, not the public.  The public is the general use option, that all faiths can use equally, and should be the last school standing in a district, no matter what.

So what happens when a district gets attendance figures so low that there's not even enough students to justify one school, and now the board is considering merging districts and having one central school for multiple districts, which is what happened in this area?

Seems to me that centralization is the RIGHT answer.  The WRONG answer is for the parents to be selfish and work with the separate board to build a new school in their district that won't be any more viable, long term, than the one that just got closed. They save a few years of shorter bus rides only to see the school close in half a decade, anyway.",0,en,0

And lets look at some unemployment rates: Greece - 22.5%, Spain - 17.7%, Italy 11.3%, France 9.6%, Portugal 9.4%. They make up almost half the euro zone and their reported unemployment averages 15%. And all those ""migrants"" aren't counted either.

"A square-shaped wrist as a predictor of carpal tunnel syndrome: A meta-analysis.
This meta-analysis aims to assess an association between wrist ratio (wrist thickness/wrist width) and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Sixteen studies qualified for a random-effects meta-analysis. Mean wrist ratio was higher in individuals with CTS compared with those without CTS [pooled mean difference 0.036, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.025-0.046]. Pooled odds ratio (OR) of CTS for mean wrist ratio was 4.56 (95% CI 2.97-6.99), and for wrist ratio ≥0.70 vs. <0.70 it was 2.73 (95% CI 1.49-5.01). In addition, the pooled OR for a 1-unit (0.01) increase in wrist ratio was 1.12 (CI 1.09-1.16). The association between wrist ratio and CTS did not differ between men and women. Moreover, there was no evidence of publication bias. This meta-analysis suggests that a square-shaped wrist is a predictor for CTS in both men and women.

"by Sarah Childress

The federal prison population has expanded by nearly 800 percent in the past 30 years, spurred in part by the increasing use of tougher sentences applied to nonviolent drug crimes.

Now there’s a growing movement to scale it back. On Thursday, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an independent federal agency, plans to vote on an amendment to sentencing guidelines that could ultimately begin to winnow the federal prison population, nearly half of whom are people convicted of drug offenses.

This month, FRONTLINE investigates America’s incarceration addiction in a two-part series, beginning with Solitary Nation , an up-close look at solitary confinement in a maximum security prison on April 22. Prison State , premiering April 29, explores the long-term effect of mass incarceration on communities caught up in a cycle of catch-and-release.

The amendment is part of a bipartisan push away from America’s addiction to incarceration, which prison reform experts say costs far too much, not only in dollars — $80 billion a year in 2010 — but also in the devastation primarily of African-American communities, who have been disproportionately caught up in the system.

The commission’s proposal would lower the sentencing guideline levels for drug-trafficking offenses, allowing judges to impose reduced sentences by about 11 months, on average, for these crimes. The guidelines are the range between which a judge can sentence an offender. Currently, those guidelines are set higher even than mandatory minimum sentences — the lowest possible sentence a judge could impose — to give prosecutors bargaining power. The amendment would set the upper and lower guideline limits around the mandatory minimums, leading to lower sentences for nearly 70 percent of drug-trafficking offenders, the commission said.

If it passes, the amendment would take effect Nov. 1 and reduce the federal population by 3 percent over the next five years. But it won’t impact the bulk of the prison population, estimated at about 2.2 million in 2012, which is locked up mainly in state prisons and jails.

The amendment would make a difference for people like Dana Bowerman, a Texas honor student who developed a meth addiction at 15, under her father’s influence. When she was 30 years old, Bowerman was arrested with her father and several others and convicted of drug conspiracy charges. Because of the stiff sentencing guidelines, she was sentenced to 19 years and seven months.

Bowerman had committed no violent crimes. She’s since kicked her habit and wants a second chance, according to Families Against Mandatory Minimums, an advocacy group that documented her story. Under the proposed amendment, she would serve 15 years and six months, Julie Stewart, FAMM’s president, said in testimony before the Sentencing Commission.

Prison reform advocates say the commission’s proposal is an incremental step, but an important one. “When you’re serving 10 years, six months can make a difference,” said Jesselyn McCurdy, an attorney with the ACLU’s Washington legislative office. “It’s incremental, but it’s all important because it sends the larger message that we have to do something about the harsh sentencing in the federal system.”

Should the Sentencing Commission’s amendment pass, it will be sent to Congress, which will have 180 days to make any changes. If it does nothing — which is the likely outcome given bipartisan Congressional support for the proposal — the resolution will take effect on Nov. 1.

Model States

For years, states, which carry the bulk of U.S. prisoners, have taken the lead on sentencing reform — largely out of necessity.

Struggling with stretched budgets and overflowing prisons, 40 states have passed laws that ease sentencing guidelines for drug crimes from 2009 to 2013, according to a comprehensive analysis by the Pew Research Center. Seventeen states have invested in reforms like drug treatment and supervision that will save about $4.6 billion over 10 years, according to the Justice Department.

Such reforms also have gained popular public support. According to Pew’s own polling, 63 percent of Americans say that states moving away from mandatory minimum sentencing is a “good thing,” up from 41 percent in 2001. Even more — 67 percent — said that states should focus on treatment, rather than punishment, for people struggling with addiction to illegal drugs.

Federal Intervention

In recent years, the Obama administration has also made moves towards sentencing reform.

In August 2013, Attorney General Eric Holder announced a change in the charging policy for federal prosecutors, instructing them not to charge low-level, non-violent drug crimes with offenses that would trigger a mandatory minimum sentence.

Mandatory minimums offer a one-size-fits-all sentencing. They eliminate the discretion that a prosecutor or judge might otherwise use in determining how to punish an offender based on mitigating circumstances, such as a first-time offender or a low-level, non-violent offense. The number of penalties that carry mandatory minimum sentences has nearly doubled from 98 to 195 over the last 20 years, according to the Sentencing Commission.

There are no proposals to alter mandatory minimums that address violent crimes, such as kidnapping and crimes against children. But a significant number of mandatory minimum sentences involve nonviolent, drug-related offenses, which advocates for reform, and now even some members of Congress, argue end up sending too many first-time offenders to prison for too long. (You can see a full list of federal mandatory minimum sentences here.)

“Many of those mandatory minimums originated right here in this committee room,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), at a recent Judiciary Committee hearing last year. “When I look at the evidence we have now, I realize we were wrong. Our reliance on a one-size-fits-all approach to sentencing has been a great mistake. Mandatory minimums are costly, unfair, and do not make our country safer.”

Prospects for Congressional Reform

The Sentencing Commission itself notes that substantial reform requires action by Congress. “Our proposed approach is modest,” said Patti Saris, the commission’s chairwoman. “The real solution rests with Congress, and we continue to support efforts there to reduce mandatory minimum penalties, consistent with our recent report finding that mandatory minimum penalties are often too severe and sweep too broadly in the drug context, often capturing lower-level players.”

There has been some movement toward reform on both sides of the aisle.

In 2010, Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and powdered cocaine, which had been at about 100 to 1 — meaning people, mostly African-Americans, served significantly more time for crack possession than those arrested for possessing the same amount of powdered cocaine. The disparity’s now at 18 to 1.

The Senate is currently considering a bill called the Smarter Sentencing Act, a bipartisan bill introduced in July 2013 by Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). It wouldn’t abolish mandatory minimums, but it would allow judges to impose more lenient sentences for certain non-violent drug offenses.

“Our current scheme of mandatory minimum sentences is irrational and wasteful,” Lee said when introducing the bill, adding that the act “takes an important step forward in reducing the financial and human cost of outdated and imprudent sentencing policies.”

It would also allow the Fair Sentencing Act to be applied retroactively to some prisoners, a move that could affect an estimated 8,800 people currently in federal prisons, according to the ACLU. The law would also lower certain mandatory minimum sentences.

But the bill, which even the senators acknowledged as “studied and modest” on their website, doesn’t have great odds of passing. According to govtrack.us, a nonpartisan website that tracks congressional legislation, the Smarter Sentencing Act has only a 39 percent chance of being enacted.",0,en,0

"Parallels between astronauts and terrestrial patients - Taking physiotherapy rehabilitation ""To infinity and beyond"".
Exposure to the microgravity environment induces physiological changes in the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and sensorimotor systems in healthy astronauts. As space agencies prepare for extended duration missions, it is difficult to predict the extent of the effects that prolonged exposure to microgravity will have on astronauts. Prolonged bed rest is a model used by space agencies to simulate the effects of spaceflight on the human body, and bed rest studies have provided some insights into the effects of immobilisation and inactivity. Whilst microgravity exposure is confined to a relatively small population, on return to Earth, the physiological changes seen in astronauts parallel many changes routinely seen by physiotherapists on Earth in people with low back pain (LBP), muscle wasting diseases, exposure to prolonged bed rest, elite athletes and critically ill patients in intensive care. The medical operations team at the European Space Agency are currently involved in preparing astronauts for spaceflight, advising on exercises whilst astronauts are on the International Space Station, and reconditioning astronauts following their return. There are a number of parallels between this role and contemporary roles performed by physiotherapists working with elite athletes and muscle wasting conditions. This clinical commentary will draw parallels between changes which occur to the neuromuscular system in the absence of gravity and conditions which occur on Earth. Implications for physiotherapy management of astronauts and terrestrial patients will be discussed.",0,en,0

"“If Black Men See Us With White Men, It Will Scare Them Away!” O_o

December 19, 2013 | Toni |

I don’t know how many ways it can be said that in this life you are free to choose and love whoever you wish. Or that spaces like this featuring women who are attracted to, dating, or married to non-black men does not change the fact black women are indeed entitled to date and marry black men if that’s what they actually want to do.

Knowing this to be so makes me wonder where in the heck some black people get their logic regarding the impact of black women-centric interracial dating on “black love” and relationships. The stupid things some black women choose to believe about themselves and the opposite sex of ANY race or ethnic group can be truly frustrating. Especially when I read an opinion so stupid, I am stunned into silence. W-T-F?

“If they keep putting black women in movies/shows with white men it’s going to scare black men away.”

*pauses because she needs a moment*

I am soooooo tired of thisLIE that black women with non-black men means that there will be no black men for the black women who want them!

Did black men with non-black women scare away the black women who only want black men? Let’s at least imagine the reverse to be true: A black man who wants a black woman is going to go after a black woman and then they are going to be a black couple REGARDLESS OF WHAT BLACK WOMEN WITH NO INTEREST IN BLACK MEN DO! REGARDLESS OF THE INCREASED REPRESENTATION OF INTERRACIAL COUPLES FEATURING BLACK WOMEN!

People who want to be together are going to be together. If a man wants to be with you, wild horses couldn’t drag him away. And if black men aren’t beating down your door, Hon, it’s not because of the idea that black women can be with men who aren’t black and be happy. Because that is a fact. If you’re lacking in black love, then it’s for a different reason entirely.

In short, you’ve been had.

I understand that the black women who believe this nonsense had help forming the idiotic belief system. There is a vocal segment of black male trolls who come to sites like this and tell us about how being with a white guy means that we are “soiled” and no black man is ever going to want us.

They say things like we’re ruined, we’re crazy, we’re desperate, etc. Whatever they feel can say to get at us and somehow trigger the same fear that has these poor women running around like chickens with their heads cut off.

The fear is real….but the threat is toothless.

1.) You are an individual. You are responsible for your own happiness. If you want to be with a man, be with him because of love, not fear. Let a man be with you because he loves and respects you. Not because he’s conned you into thinking you’re worthless because you’re black and “no other man would want you”.

2.) Speaking of “nobody wants you”, this is simply not true. It breaks my heart that I still see black women believing that there’s no men anywhere that would love them because they are black. The idea that a man who is not black appreciating you is somehow wrong is nothing more than the impotent mouth-drippings of cowards who needed other groups of men to notice you before ever getting around to seeing your value. And now that they’re late, they’re mad. That’s their loss, not your problem. You are a hot commodity and the secret is getting out.

3.) Once that secret is out and the wall completely shattered, the floodgates will open. It’s not if, but WHEN. Black women of value and means will be snatched up so fast, it will make your head spin. It’s scary to some DBRs that the day will come where they can no longer convince black women to man-share, “because there aren’t enough to go around.” They shudder at the idea of black women laughing in their face as they step past them and into the arms of whomever they choose.

4.) If you can’t beat them…trick them. Keep black women running around believing that interracial relationships involving other women drop their value in the eyes of black men. That keeps them snapping and yelling at any non-black man who expresses interest. That keeps them going on loud rants about how they only want a black man. And it also has them invading the conversations and spaces of black women who were never checking for the men they want.

These duped women don’t know that-

5.) THE OPPOSITE IS ACTUALLY TRUE. The quickest way to get a black man’s attention is to say, “I like Swedish men. :D” In fact, if these women who want black men so badly were to say this in a room full of black men and stick to the lie, I believe they’d be beating off black men with a tree.

Reverse psychology is a hell of a drug, after all. These women should know: They’ve been downing the pills for some time.

Black women dating whoever they want isn’t going to drive away quality men: the sort of men they’re supposed to be checking for in the first place! If a man is scared away because he doesn’t like the race of the men you’ve dated or that black women are exercising their options, consider yourself lucky!

"Sears is a classic model of mismanagement. 
They kept removing products which brought people into the stores.
I used to enter malls through the Sears Hardware department; checking what was on sale. Then I would pass through the other departments on the way into the mall. I would often buy something on my way.
I have thousands of dollars of Craftsman Tools and equipment. They were good quality and well supported.
Someone decided that Hardware wasn't making enough sales in some stores, so they removed that department and stopped supporting their products with parts and service.
I and many others stopped entering the mall that way, and passing through Sears.
Similarly with Kenmore appliances; they took that department out of the stores.
The Sears ""Clearance Center"" used to have good items at good prices. That became a place full of high priced junk; no reason to go there.
The ""experts"" kept removing ""slow moving"" products till nothing was moving at all.

"Is a false choice a choice?

Charter schools are often held to a different, lower standard. They frequently dodge tough requirements (like Specialc Education) and leave public schools to fund more expensive programs, with less money. They have proven to provide mixed results, and to be just as succeptable to corruption as anywhere else. 

Money siphoned from my community shouldn't be spent in private institutions that community members cannot afford. If the public is paying for it, there shouldn't be a service even the meanest among us cannot afford. This isn't about choice, it's really about whether our public dollars should be wasted on a dozen spurious programs and private programs most cannot afford, or invested wisely into a small collection of institutions.

FRIENDS IN STRAIGHT-JACKETS...

Last night was a fucking blast. Getting together with Sara and Denise (my hags) is always candy on a stick, but yesterday evening began with a TIVO extravaganza of Medium, and a night-cap of ensuing mayhem and mockery.

Always a target for hag abuse, as soon as we settled into Denise's computer room these Jackals surrounded me and began their scheduled torture session. Denise (as always) begins her successive verbal probes, sparking and fueling Sara's sleeping sadist within. Together they precisely pounced me in every way imaginable. Ranging from a passing poke to the ribs, or vulgerly attempting to stick their index finger up my ass for a quick chuckle, or maybe even a simultaneous blitzkrieg to ensure that I'm on my game at all times. I've grown agile and resiliant thanks to the Twin Terrors you know. It sounds unbalanced and screwy I know, but it's something I look forward to every Sunday and Thursday.

For what it's worth, I wouldn't trade in the bobby pin throwing, the punches to my thighs (thanks a bunch for that Sara), the hiding behind the wall so when I exit the bathroom unsuspectingly, the beast of the bush will leap at me with a deafening, cacophonus howl from hell, in turn twisting my face in complete horror (thanks a bunch for that Dee). Last but not least, I wouldn't trade in the scathing banter we so gracefully perfected over time. Without the loving bashes and manic mental games, things would be... well... unvaried and tedious. Love you bishes.",1,en,1

"Martin paints an interesting picture. However, there are significant differences between the political systems of the US and Canada that will affect the outcome.

The US has had a two party political system for almost as long as it has existed. Canada, on the other hand, has had a weak but viable third party since the 1960's. A viable third party in the US will likely spook voters. 

Once RC and Bannon declare themselves the GOP will expel the dissidents and rally the populace to its side. That does not mean it will win an election. The Democrats will probably clean up at first while the GOP rebuilds.

I see the GOP going a different path compared to Canada. I do not see the radicals replacing the moderate elements of the GOP over the long run as the Reform Party did with the PC's.",0,en,0

Get some point location using the degrees based on the main point

Is there any way to get the P2's location (x, y) knowing the P1's location (30, 30) and the degrees between them?

Yes, I know the center location, and the P1 will be always above it.The angle can be from 0º to 360º.

A:

You're actually just trying to find a point on a circle, given it's angle (from the top rather than the right side) and the radius of the circle.
X = center.X + r * cos(90 - angle)  
Y = center.Y + r * sin(90 - angle)

"Vip is right. The side of America that Trump has exposed is truly frightening. How anyone could support him after his first week in office, in which he has insulted literally half of the rest if the world, is beyond me.

Everyone seems to see something different in the Orange Enigma. Charlie Dalton sees him as the embodiment of racism, and assumes that his supporters are mostly white supremacists. A gay friend of mine sees him as a gay-basher, even though he has never made any overtly anti-gay statements. A lot of people seem to see him as some sort of savior, because he's not an establishment tool and he speaks his mind (mostly because he does not have the social maturity to know when to shut up). I think what we see in him reflects more about the observer than it does about Trump the man (a term I use with reluctance).

Me - I see him as an immature and not very bright egomaniac, a true bully, under the thrall of his handlers - much like Reagan was, though in spades.",0,en,0

VIOS and a few High Performance Computing (HPC) products. Input of
product levels at FLRT's web-based interface produced a recommendations

Don't Ask Taylor Momsen of the Pretty Reckless About Gossip Girl

The Pretty Reckless currently has a hell of a lot to be happy about. The band's latest album, Going to Hell, has already produced two hit tunes -- ""Heaven Knows"" and ""Fucked Up World"" -- and the group just kicked off the second leg of its North American tour.

It's no surprise that Taylor Momsen, who once acted in Gossip Girl, is heading straight to the top. What is surprising is that she's been able to do it with aggressive rock & roll. While most music geared to 21-year-old girls is total ""popcorn"" pop, as Momsen calls it, she told us she's on a much different musical path.

As for whether we'll be seeing Momsen on the big or little screen again, the answer is, probs not. We found this all out and so much more when speaking with Momsen before the tour brings the Pretty Reckless to the Pageant on October 23.

Ashley Zimmerman: What's the best part about performing live?

Playing. Playing is the best part. It's so much fun to get on stage and crank amps and play, and we have a setlist that we throw up onstage, but we can deviate from that if we feel like it. And connecting with the audience is always amazing, and hearing your fans sing your songs back to you is the greatest compliment you can get as a songwriter. So there's kind of no downside. But playing is the highlight of every gig, unless you suck. And then you just want to redo it.

I love that you love rock and that you care about making good music that's raw and real, and doesn't cater to music-industry trends. You're 21 and a lot of girls your age are into pop. I love that you love Nirvana and Garbage. Do you think rock is going to make a comeback on mainstream radio anytime soon?

I don't know. You know my line is, I don't think rock can ever die, I think it's just resting at the moment. [Laughs] I think it comes down to, you know -- I say rock & roll all the time, 'cause it is. But at the end of the day, it comes down to good songs and just good music that takes time to create, by a real artist, and not having a song by a manufactured artist for the machine. Like, no more popcorn. Popcorn is great for the movies and for two hours -- it's entertaining -- but at the end of the day I think people want a little bit of depth in their lives.

Personally, I think pop is for kids. I think it's kids' music for kids, and I'm not that kind of artist, and I'm not making that type of music. So if the kids can relate to what I'm trying to say or musically what I'm trying to do, then I've succeeded as a songwriter.

Which is why touring is so fun, because you get up onstage and.... You know, I write a record and I go away for a year -- or however long it takes -- and isolate myself from the world to write a record, and then you put it out into the world. And you have no idea how the response is going to be, and then you go play it live, and you see how many people have actually not just heard the songs but connected to them and are responding to them and understand them on multiple levels. It's the highest compliment.

What was the first CD you bought as a kid?

Well, I didn't actually have to buy a lot of CDs as a kid because I grew up on my dad's vinyl collection. So he already kind of had all the great music. He's a big rock & roll fan and I grew up on the Beatles. They're my favorite band of all time. They did everything, and I worship them.

So I grew up on the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, the Who, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, and then as I got a little bit older in my teens I got into the '90s like Nirvana, Soundgarden. We just played with Soundgarden, and it was my favorite gig ever because I fucking love Soundgarden. And then I got into Pearl Jam and all that shit, and then I went back to the earlier blues. I always get the question asked to me, do you have anything embarrassing on your iPod, and I'm always like, ""No, I only like good music."" I like artists who have sat there and are actually saying something.

I saw your music video for ""Fucked Up World"" and, first of all, it's an awesome song.

Thank you, it just went No. 1 yesterday, so we have two Nos. 1 on the rock charts right now. Currently ""Heaven Knows"" is No. 1 on mainstream rock, and ""Fucked Up World"" is No. 1 on active rock. We have two Nos. 1 on different rock charts from the same record, which is pretty awesome.

I didn't even know if this record was going to come out, and I certainly didn't know if there'd be any hits on it. And now we have two Nos. 1, so it's cool in my mind. I'm not gonna lie.

I wanted to talk about that video. What was the concept behind it and the message you were trying to put out?

Yeah, well, I wrote the treatment, I co-directed it with Jon J, who I also directed with on the ""Heaven Knows"" video and wrote the treatment for that. The ""Fucked Up World"" video was meant to be a take on pop culture. That's cynical in some way, I guess. It's a very sarcastic video in that it's a fucked-up, world and everybody is smiling about it on the beach in tie-dye. And what are you going to do? It's a fucked-up world. I'm not lying.

Continue to page two.

What about acting? Do you see Gossip Girl as your last project, or do you think you'll end up acting again at some point?

I see Gossip Girl as my childhood, to be honest. I see acting as my childhood. It's just something that I got put into at a very young age, and it was six years ago, and I keep saying how many Nos. 1 do you have to have before people stop asking about acting? Because I've had three at this point, and I still get asked about Gossip Girl, which was six years ago that I quit.

I'm not looking to go back to it. Gossip Girl was a great experience, and it helped in one way and hurt in another, but it feels like forever ago. I've been around the world 7 billion times since then, and when we go to shows, the fans don't give a fuck about the TV show. They're there for the music, for the songs and the records and what we've created as a band.

What has been the most fulfilling or exciting moment so far in your musical career?

Well, this record. I think the goal of every artist is to have every record be better than the last. And it's a non-commercial record in every way -- like there's no hits on this record, and the fact that there's two is insane. It wasn't even going to fucking come out. There was no record label at the time we made it, and now we have two Nos. 1 in rock in America.

Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

As a female, and it's fucking great. I mean it's crazy, but it's amazing.

What's next for you and the band after the tour?

Well, the tour goes for about three months, and then we'll probably be going around the rest of the world, South America, Asia, Europe.

There should be a big U.S. tour again in the spring. And in between all of those tours, we're starting to write the next record right now. Hopefully we'll get in the studio, so there's not such a giant amount of time between records this time.

There's too much heartache in this record. We went through a lot to make this record, Going to Hell, from a national disaster with a hurricane to the death of very close family members in the entire band. There's a lot of tainted pain in this record, and I think we're really excited that it's doing so well and that people are hearing that and responding to it but at the same time. I've got new songs, and I'm ready to fucking record them.

Can you tell me a little bit about the new songs?

Uh....nope. [Laughs] Not yet, not yet. But there will be a new single off this record, so there's going to be more videos and stuff, but that's all in the works right now.

What's one thing about you that would surprise most people?

The way tabloids have promoted the band or me personally and the way I'm perceived on the Internet is really inaccurate. So that's the biggest thing I think. I'm just a fucking chick in a band. I mean I've worked my whole life, and I just like writing songs and I like playing music. So I think the biggest thing that would surprise people is that I'm actually pretty fucking normal. I mean, I'm a little bit out of my mind -- I'm a writer, so like any artist I'm a little bit insane -- but I think the way the Internet perceives me is entirely wrong.

I constantly meet people and they go, ""Wow, she's so nice"" or, ""You're so down to earth,"" or whatever. It's like yeah, I'm just a fucking dude, man. I'm just a normal fucking person who likes doing what I do. I'm not trying to shock people, and I think that's probably the biggest misconception of me. Frankly, it's all a bunch of bullshit. If you want to know about me or the band, listen to the fucking songs, it's all right there. My entire life is in the songs.",1,en,1

"Justice On The Horizon For “Central Park Five” After de Blasio Elected

The five African-American teenagers robbed of their youth by a White lynch mob

AFRICANGLOBE – According to filmmaker Ken Burns, who last year brought out a documentary on the notorious and racially charged story of the “Central Park Five” — five Black boys wrongfully convicted of raping a White female jogger — newly elected New York Mayor Bill de Blasio will finally settle the case.

In a now-renowned miscarriage of justice, the “Central Park Five” spent a decade in prison for the rape, convicted on scant evidence, false admissions and racist fervor, before the actual rapist turned himself in.

To this day, the five men have had an open civil lawsuit against the city for wrongful conviction and reparations. Burns told reporters that, finally, when de Blasio takes office he will settle the 10-year-old case.

“Bill de Blasio, the mayor-elect, has agreed to settle this case, and though this is justice delayed way too long, and that is justice denied, [they] will not only be exonerated … but they will have justice, they will see some closure, they will be able to be made whole,” said Burns, whose film “The Central Park Five” detailed the injustice the men, convicted as juveniles, faced.

Context for including afferent nerves in a mental practice thread? Wha???

Yes, that's right. You need to introduce a context, if they are of any relevance. I know full well what the terms means and I see no relevance to the issues under discussin at all. After this is a PRACTICAL discussion, not an open university anatomy course. As I said, if you are frequently met with silence (as I suspect) when you introduce such terms to conversations without establishing context, that is because people are too embarrased to respond to such a transparent attempt at one-up-manship, not because they are overwhelmed by deference to somebody who has correcetly learned an unusal word.

Well, at least it clarifies how to give ACCURATE explanations and understanding, when you have to deal with a complete imbecile. Fortunately, my students are far better at absorbing simple logical premises. Arguably I'm learning something by being forced to explain things in simple terms to an idiot. I wonder what kbk draws from this?

One of the major benefits of mental practice is less noise from the afferent nerves. Is that context? I'm baffled here.

And? Nobody ever argued against the benefits of mental practise. So what is your point? Why are you suddently introducing this? The whole discussion was about your nonsensical assertions about the nature of muscle memory and how it is supposedly harmful- coupled with your definable error in claiming the muscle-memory based method you started was based on avoiding muscle memory. So rather than admit to that, you choose to introduce a separate issue about anatomy, without explanation or context, or supportive evidence? And you wonder why whole rooms of people often go silent when you start to speak at parties?

For what it's worth I just reported this post. Do you really think you can call people imbeciles and idiots?

Yeah, when they give extremely flawed advice that goes in the face of all logic to other posters (not to mention openly admitting to deliberately acting like a fool so as to spoil any hope of a proper discussion) I think that it would be criminal not to. I'll run back and report a selection of your own posts.

Frankly, if I was the moderator, I'd have banned you from this forum a long time ago. You openly admit to using it to wind people up, rather than as place to engage in serious discussions? Small wonder that so many people have sent me private messages to thank me for countering the persistent bilge and condescending manner that you perpetually employ. Various posters have told me that they just avoid making posts, rather than subject themselves to your sarcastic responses. This forum would be a far richer place without you. I select the word idiot, after extremely willful thought, not as a knee-jerk reaction.

I wish I had a witty headline, like “Bono’s bits and Aram’s pieces,” but I guess I do.

Perhaps the thing that excites me the most about the term “roller coaster” is the possibility of there one day being a hover coaster.

I hope the Martians land on St. Patrick’s Day. Then they’d think we’re cool.

I was woken up by some people clapping, cheering and ringing a cowbell every few seconds. It turns out there was a marathon going down the street, but at first, it was like I was being applauded for sleeping. It was great, because you always hear about people who feel bad after sleeping wrong. I did it right.

But perhaps the best part about having a marathon go by your house is staying inside and making omelets.

Eggos are gross, but they have a hell of an advertising campaign, so they get away with it. When that came out, I bet the people in charge of marketing beans were like, “Shit. We were so close. ‘Leggo my legume,’ that would’ve been perfect. We would’ve sold millions.” They did, but it was because they made the product very small.

And before you get really mad and think I’m saying God is in advertising, he is.

Ok, I give in. You can use the term Sacratomato if you agree to get dickslapped. It’s not even a good pun. If you want something that works, try

Step 1: Choose something you like.

Step 2: Choose a word or phrase that shows you like it.

Step 3: Choose the last two digits of your birth year. (This may be substituted by a number that shows you really like that thing you chose).

Step 4: Combine 1 through 3 with intentional disregard for grammar or dignity.

The freakier you get.

Names that could also be things you have to pay extra for:

British translation:

Jack Skellington on weed: “I am the sofa king!”

I’m waiting for society to wake up one day and say, “Cats? WTF were we thinking?”

I saw a bumper sticker that just said, “Jesus is coming,” and then it had a phone number. I need three things:

1. A company that makes custom bumper stickers

2. The number of a gay Mexican phone sex line

3. A coke

It’s too hot for clothes. Neighbors, I’m sorry.

Or you’re welcome.

Problemas del mundo primero:

Sorry. I get kinda douchey when I get political.

Btw, republicans, is that still an ok ladybits action?

Mak-a me nervous.

I asked my friend, Amanda, if I could call her “Amandapanda,” and she refused. Anyone who doesn’t accept the nickname “Amandapanda” doesn’t know what cute is.

“Hey, hot stuff. What’s your name?”

“Jeff. But you can call me ‘Amandapanda.’”

Robin: “Amandapanda has unleashed her forces all over Gotham!”

Batman: “It’s like the cutest infestation ever.”

The superhero world seems a bit catty and insecure. Everyone is trying to one-up each other.

Superman

Ultraman

Man, Fighter 2 Turbo Hyper Fighting

Antman

If you haven’t seen the new Batman, Bain is voiced by Sean Connery going down on ProTools.

I’ve seen enough superhero movies to know what they’re doing. It’s all marketing. Next summer we’ll have another movie.

RoboScot

I heard a bit of this new song, maybe you can help me out. It goes something like:

I just met you.

And this is crazy.

But here’s my number.

I want to fuck you like an animal.

“My life needs to be more G rated… The world scares me :(” – my Mormon friend

Maybe I should start deleting people.

I’m a writer, which means I don’t have health insurance. I was walking across my kitchen the other day, when my knee started hurting. I immediately thought of all the shit I didn’t do. I didn’t exercise, so that was out. I didn’t take the lord’s name in vain.

Wait. Fuck. I did. That’s kinda what I do. There is a god. And he strikes about 24 inches from the floor. If you live on the second floor. People, if you value your ligaments, you’d better start going to church. It’s too late for me. But that’s ok. I’m pretty sure they can replace what’s broken with a part from a dead pig.

I still get CareerBuilder emails because I’m lazy about unsubscribing, and the most recent one offered a position as a bath fitter, which is odd because I don’t.

That joke is only funny if you’re over 6 feet tall. And if you aren’t, using the top shelf is like sex.

Names that could also be things you have to pay extra for:

Some companies get a bit too dramatic with their phone numbers. I saw a carpeting truck that said in big, red letters: CALL 499-HELP. This could lead to potentially fatal misunderstandings. Someone who is in legit trouble dials for help, and they get carpeting. At least they make same week appointments. That can’t be entirely bad.

I think I just wrote a 1970s porno.

I shall call it “Chick-fil-A.”

I like how some things are named after their creators: Allen Wrench, Mendelevium, Rubik’s Cube. I’m pretty sure that whenever Kevlar makes the news, some dude named Kev is going, “Yes! That’s my-lar!”

They can’t all be winners. If the Olympics taught us one thing, it’s that swimmers Nair.

Names that could also be things you have to pay extra for:

I got a smartphone, which I highly recommend because you can make your own ringtone. I made one that’s the sound of my phone on vibrate. It’s just like having it on vibrate, but it doesn’t move. I have a very sensitive upper thigh.

Plus I like to have people answer my phone as a practical joke, like a joy buzzer that doesn’t buzz.

“Hey, would you get that?”

“Um, dude, it’s in your pocket.”

“Trust me, you’re going to like this.”

It works great on the elderly.

I don’t have a microwave. If I did, I would record the ding and make it my ringtone in order to give those around me false hopes.

“Dammit, Bono. Fooled me again. I thought I was about to get a burrito.”

The microwave burrito is its own first aid. You just have to keep eating.

Shopping list:

Milk

Milk

Lemonade

There’s more, but I’ll have to go somewhere else.

Linguistics fans: “Jason Statham” backwards spells “butt sex.”

That’s the formula for Pig Italian.

Have you found Jesus? If so, we could totally make a killing.

I saw a woman walking down the street wearing an “I < 3 ME” shirt. But I’m skeptical. I doubt she’s ever been to Maine.

"Olivia Rossetti Agresti

Olivia Rossetti Agresti (30 September 1875 – 6 November 1960) was a British activist, author, editor, and interpreter. A member of one of England's most prominent artistic and literary families, her unconventional political trajectory began with anarchism, continued with the League of Nations, and ended with Italian fascism. Her involvement with the latter led to an important correspondence and friendship with Ezra Pound, who mentions her twice in his Cantos.

Anarchism 

Olivia Rossetti Agresti was born in London to William Michael Rossetti, one of the seven founding members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the editor of its literary magazine The Germ. A granddaughter of Gabriele Rossetti and Ford Madox Brown, she was hence a niece of Maria Francesca Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Christina Rossetti, as well as a first cousin of Ford Madox Ford.

While still in their girlhood, Olivia and her sister, the future Helen Rossetti Angeli (1879-1969), began publishing an anarchist journal, The Torch, in the basement of their family home. Despite their youth, this effort became the nucleus of a prominent anarchist salon which included Peter Kropotkin and Sergei Kravchinski, and their publishing coups included the pamphlet Why I Am an Anarchist by George Bernard Shaw. Years later, using the pseudonym ""Isabel Meredith"", Olivia and Helen published A Girl Among the Anarchists, a somewhat fictionalized memoir of their days as precocious child revolutionaries. These adventures were also chronicled by their cousin Ford Madox Ford in his 1931 memoir Return to Yesterday.

A more permanent consequence of this political activity was Olivia's marriage in 1897 to the Italian anarchist and journalist Antonio Agresti (1866-1926), which led to her emigration from England to Italy. Olivia was to remain there for the rest of her life and she eventually became an Italian citizen. During her first years in Italy she continued with literary activities related to her political activism, including a biography of the Italian painter and revolutionary Giovanni Costa.

Internationalism 

The second phase in Agresti's career began in 1904, when she met the American agricultural reformer David Lubin. A former department store and mail order magnate from Sacramento, Lubin was in Rome seeking a state sponsor for his idea of an international clearinghouse for agricultural statistics. Unable to speak Italian, Lubin hired Agresti as his interpreter and thus began a close collaboration between the two which continued until Lubin's death.

With Agresti's assistance, Lubin's efforts in Italy made history. After gaining the unexpected support of Italy's king Victor Emmanuel III, Lubin's vision became a reality with the 1905 founding of the International Institute of Agriculture, headquartered in Rome. The first modern international organization, it was hailed as a significant forerunner of world government by such luminaries as H. G. Wells and Louis Brandeis. Agresti includes samples of Lubin's correspondence with Wells and Brandeis in her 1922 biography David Lubin: A Study in Practical Idealism.

Following Lubin's death in 1919, Agresti waged a public campaign for close cooperation between the International Institute of Agriculture and the nascent League of Nations, which soon employed her as a member of the staff to Italy's delegation. She continued as a staff interpreter for the League in Geneva from 1922 to 1930. Her last assignment as a professional interpreter occurred in 1945 when, at the personal request of Italy's prime minister, Alcide De Gasperi, she accompanied him to London for meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers. According to her unpublished memoirs, meetings at which Agresti interpreted included Ernest Bevin and Vyacheslav Molotov.

Fascism 

By 1921 Agresti's early anarchist leanings, further leavened by years of exposure to Lubin's theories concerning cooperative organization of society, had transformed her into an enthusiastic supporter of corporatism and, consequently, of Benito Mussolini's corporatist reorganization of the Italian economy. From 1921 to 1943 she edited the newsletter of the Associazione fra le Società per Azioni, a group then closely allied with the Fascists, and in 1938 co-authored the theoretical work The Organization of the Arts and Professions in the Fascist Guild State with the Fascist journalist Mario Missiroli.

In 1937, Agresti's editorship of economic journals brought her into professional contact with Ezra Pound, then residing in Italy and writing articles in Italian on economic topics. Thus began a long correspondence between the two which lasted until 1959, the year before Agresti's death. Agresti seems to have been unaware of Pound's fame as a poet, and Pound unaware of Agresti's family ties to Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Ford Madox Ford, two of the most important influences on his poetry, until years into the correspondence. Portions of this correspondence were edited and published in 1998 by the University of Illinois Press.

Agresti became practically a member of Pound's extended family as the years progressed, and she and her two adopted Italian daughters were frequent guests at Schloss Brunnenburg. She was active for years in the international campaign to free Pound from his involuntary incarceration in a mental asylum by the government of the United States, and Pound in turn tried to assist her, then suffering from an impecunious old age, by finding a publisher for her memoirs. Pound refers to Agresti twice in his Cantos.

"Focus Features is pushing “The Book of Henry” into 2017.

That means that the Colin Trevorrow drama won’t be in the hunt for Oscars … at least not this year. “The Book of Henry” centers on a single mother raising a child prodigy. It was originally slated to debut in limited release on Sept. 16, 2016, before going wide on Sept. 30. The new plan is for “The Book of Henry” to bow on June 16, 2017, in limited release, then gradually expand through the rest of the month into the July 4th holiday. Its new release date coincides with the debuts of “Kingsman: The Golden Circle” and “Cars 3,” but it’s a time period with little in the way of indie dramas.

The film has been testing well, according to insiders, and the hope is that the new date will give it more room to find its audience. The summer is a bit of a wasteland for adult-oriented fare, and Focus is betting that “The Book of Henry” will be able to attract older crowds who may not be enamored of costume heroes and animated adventures. The studio still thinks the film is strong enough to warrant awards attention.

Focus has a robust slate this fall. The indie label is fielding the historical drama “Loving,” Tom Ford’s “Nocturnal Animals,” and the fantasy adventure “A Monster Calls,” all of which are generating awards buzz. After flirting with becoming a more genre-oriented label, the company underwent an overhaul earlier this year with the intention of returning it to its indie roots. Focus originally made a name for itself producing the likes of “Brokeback Mountain” and “The Pianist.” As part of the shift, longtime executive Peter Kujawski replaced Peter Schlessel as the label’s head.

Trevorrow recently directed “Jurassic World” and is about to join the keepers of the “Star Wars” franchise when he oversees “Episode IX.” Before getting into the blockbuster game, he first captured attention with the Sundance hit “Safety Not Guaranteed.” Oscar nominee Naomi Watts stars in “The Book of Henry,” along with Jacob Tremblay (“Room”), and Jaeden Lieberher (“Midnight Special”). Other cast members include comedian Sarah Silverman, Dean Norris, (“Breaking Bad”) and Lee Pace (“Guardians of the Galaxy”). Crime novelist Gregg Hurwitz wrote the screenplay.

Executive producers include Sue Baden-Powell, John Penotti, Nick Meyer, Bruce Toll. Sidney Kimmel, Carla Hacken, Jenette Kahn, and Adam Richman produced the movie.",0,en,0

Kevin your systematic deletion and suppression of the multi level cosmology stinks of inquisition. Either you are too limited to open up your mind to other non-standard cosmologies, which, by the way, explain the universe much better than the """"classic"""" cosmologies, or your behavior is motivated by extremist religious beliefs. This is cosmology, this is not religion, you should go publish your beliefs in the section on religion and you should stop vandalizing Wikipedia. It seems that you have nothing better to do than day and night look for any mention of the multi-level cosmology in Wikipedia and systematically deleting it. Yes, some time ago the entire article on multi-level cosmology was deleted, but I think the deletion was premature and was the result of the unorthodox explanations of the theory. So even though the full article has been deleted, there is no reason, in the interest of science, not to mention the multi-level cosmology in other sections, and let others decide whether or not it is valid. Censorship, inquisition and suppression of science is counterproductive and harms science. If you are so obsessed with censorship of Wikipedia, do you also censor the articles in Tampa Tribune?

If determined to be a refugee then those proceedings are no longer on the table. That is in accordance with our international agreements of refugees and refugee claimants.",0,en,0

"Q:

jQuery Multiple Panel Toggle

I'm working on a portfolio site for an iPhone developer. In this site the iPhone app icons will act as a toggle buttons for panels that describe the application. The panels animate over the main page content. To add to this, if a panel is open and another app icon is clicked the open panels will need to close and the next app will open. Currently the script I have works great for toggling a single panel, see here: http://cncpts.me/dev/
So how can change the current script so it accepts multiple ids or classes, without creating duplicate code?
Here is the jQuery that is driving the functionality for a single toggle action. 
    $(document).ready(function() {
    $(""li.panel_button"").click(function(){
        $(""div#panel"").animate({
            height: ""700px""
        })
        .animate({
            height: ""600px""
        }, ""slower"");
        $(""div.panel_button"").toggle('zoom'); return false

    }); 

   $(""div#hide_button"").click(function(){
        $(""div#panel"").animate({
            height: ""0px""
        }, ""slower"");   return false

   });  

});

Here is the HTML:
<div id=""panel""> 
            <div id=""panel_contents""></div>
                <img src=""images/iphone.png"" border=""0"" alt=""iPhone Development"">
                <div class=""panel_button"" id=""hide_button"" style=""display: none;"">  
                <a href=""#""><img src=""images/collapse.png"" alt=""collapse"" /></a>  
                </div>
        </div>

A:

give the list items a rel attribute that points to the div you are trying to show/hide.
<li rel='#panel_1' class='panel_button'> 

give all the div's a common class such as 'flyaway', do a hide on any div with the same class that is not currently hidden 
$('.flyaway').not(':hidden').animate({ height: ""0px""}, ""slower"");  

and show the one you want 
$(""li.panel_button"").click(function(){
        $($(this).attr('rel')).animate({
            height: ""700px""
        })
        .animate({
            height: ""600px""
        }, ""slower"");
        $($(this).attr('rel')+"" div.panel_button"").toggle('zoom'); return false

"Rediscovering Americanism: And the Tyranny of Progressivism

In Rediscovering Americanism, Mark R.

Levin returns to the impassioned question he's explored in each of his best-selling books: How do we save our exceptional country? Because our values are in such a precarious state, he argues that a restoration to the essential truths on which our country was founded has never been more urgent.

The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left

What is ""the big lie"" of the Democratic Party? That conservatives - and President Donald Trump in particular - are fascists. Nazis, even. In a typical comment, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow says the Trump era is reminiscent of ""what it was like when Hitler first became chancellor."" But in fact, this audacious lie is a complete inversion of the truth. Yes, there is a fascist threat in America - but that threat is from the Left and the Democratic Party.

The Smear: How Shady Political Operatives and Fake News Control What You See, What You Think, and How You Vote

Behind most major political stories in the modern era, there is an agenda - an effort by opposition researchers, spin doctors, and outside interests to destroy an idea or a person. The tactic they use is the Smear. Every day, Americans are influenced by the Smear without knowing it. Paid forces cleverly shape virtually every image you cross. Maybe you read that Donald Trump is a racist misogynist or saw someone on the news mocking the Bernie Sanders campaign. The trick of the Smear is that it is often based on some shred of truth.

In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome! (That Was the Easy Part) and Is Fighting for US

Donald Trump isn't a politician - he's a one-man wrecking ball against our dysfunctional and corrupt establishment. We're about to see the deluxe version of the left's favorite theme: Vote for us, or we'll call you stupid. It's the working class against the smirking class. Now Ann Coulter, with her unique insight, candor, and sense of humor, makes the definitive case for why we should all join his revolution.

Bullies: How the Left's Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences Americans

Ben Shapiro uncovers the simple strategy used by liberals and their friends in the media: bully the living hell out of conservatives. Play the race card, the class card, the sexism card. Use any and every means at your disposal to demonize your opposition - to shut them up. Then pretend that such bullying is justified because, after all, conservatives are the true bullies and need to be taught a lesson for their intolerance.

Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America

The demon is a mob, and the mob is demonic. The Democratic Party activates mobs, depends on mobs, coddles mobs, publicizes and celebrate mobs - it is the mob. Sweeping in its scope and relentless in its argument, Demonic explains the peculiarities of liberals as standard groupthink behavior. To understand mobs is to understand liberals.

SJWs Always Lie: Taking Down the Thought Police

Social justice warriors have plagued mankind for more than 150 years, but only in the last 30 years has their ideology become dominant in the West.

Big Agenda: President Trump's Plan to Save America

One battle is over, but there are many more to come. This book is an indispensable guide to fighting the opponents of the conservative restoration. It identifies who the adversaries are, as well as their methods, motivations, and agenda, including the particular issues with which they will try to advance their destructive goal - and it lays out a strategy to defeat all of it.

America has become increasingly divided and polarized in recent years. With growing animosity toward law enforcement professionals, government corruption, disregard for the constitution, and racial tension thanks to the media and hate groups, there seems to be no easy answer in sight. But Sheriff David Clarke knows where we must begin. We must stop blaming others and take ownership of our families, communities, and country.

Clean House: Exposing Our Government's Secrets and Lies

Americans are rightly worried they are losing their country. How did five congressional committees miss the smoking gun on Benghazi? How did Hillary Clinton keep a secret email server quiet for years? Does the IRS audit you because of your politics? Did the first American target of Obama's drone program work for the US government? How did Congress commit fraud to get Obamacare taxpayer subsidies? In Clean House Tom Fitton answers these questions and provides shocking evidence of the corruption endemic to the Obama White House.

Understanding Trump

Donald Trump is unlike any president we've ever had. He is the only person ever elected to be commander in chief who has not first held public office or served as a general in the military. His principles grow out of five decades of business and celebrity success - not politics - so he behaves differently from traditional politicians.

Old School: Life in the Sane Lane

You have probably heard the term Old School, but what you might not know is that there is a concentrated effort to tear that school down. It's a values thing. The anti–Old School forces believe the traditional way of looking at life is oppressive. Not inclusive. The Old School way may harbor microaggressions. Therefore, Old School philosophy must be diminished. Those crusading against Old School now have a name: Snowflakes. You may have seen them on cable TV whining about social injustice and income inequality.

Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left

""Fascists"", ""Brownshirts"", ""jackbooted stormtroopers"" - such are the insults typically hurled at conservatives by their liberal opponents. Calling someone a fascist is the fastest way to shut them up, defining their views as beyond the political pale. But who are the real fascists in our midst?

Publisher's Summary

If you believe children should be seduced into warped sexual behavior by the Gay Elite, if you think confessed murderers should be set free by defense attorneys who know how to wield the race card, if you feel promiscuous gay men should be empowered to spread AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, don't read this book.

But if you've always suspected that factions on the Left are trying to destroy the values that define our civilization, this book proves it. Through The Death of Right and Wrong, author, activist, and pundit Tammy Bruce takes you inside the chilling world of the Left - a place where morals and decency have been turned on their heads and the crisp distinction between Right and Wrong has been blurred into a mushy, gray mess.

Ms. Bruce smashes the facades of ""Tolerance,"" ""Understanding,"" and other Leftist slogans to reveal the ugly truth of their agenda. As a gay activist and former president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization of Women, she witnessed firsthand the Left's attempts to undermine our millennia-old code of morals and values, aided by politically biased media and academia. And if the news headlines of today are any indication, they're winning the culture war. Unless we act now, we are doomed at the hands of special interest groups on the Left who want nothing more that to undermine our ability to judge right from wrong in order to foist their own selfish, anything-goes society on the rest of us. This book reveals what they're doing, how they're doing it, and what we can do to restore decency in our society.

You'll discover powerful tools to help you understand the psychology of the Left - what makes them tick, and, more importantly, how to stop them from eroding our values completely. Full of controversial opinions and countless examples ripped from the headlines, The Death of Right and Wrong is a powerful, eye-opening book that you won't want to be without.

I am a long-time admirer of Ms. Bruce. I cancelled my membership in NOW when I realized that they were not an organization out to help women, but to defend the icons and special interests of the left--even if doing so destroyed a woman's life or reputation. Ms. Bruce has confirmed this to be a fact through her various interviews, articles, and previous book. In the ""Death of Right and Wrong"", she further details the hypocrisy of the elite Left, and since she is an ""insider"", her observations are especially profound.

Not being familiar with Ms. Bruce's work or history, I was pleasantly surprised by her handling of the subject matter. From an insiders' perspective, she takes the libral elite to task, and in the process exposes one of the most dangerous agendas on the public stage. In defining and exposing the left's ""newspeak"" and intolerance of true dissenting opinion she portays a morally and ethically bankrupt movement which has pitted itself against the overwhelming majority of Americans, while simultaneously espousing their dogma as the dangerous, antisocial agenda that it is. Hearing Ms. Bruce read her book, as opposed to ""reading"" it, is an added bonus. One cannot listen to her without hearing the passion that she brings to the subject matter. Considering her background, the added dimension makes this book a real gem.

I was not familiar with the author, but the subject matter was interesting. It is even more interesting when learning her background, beliefs and postions on issues.
It's nice to know the despite certain differences of opinion, we can agree on the basics.
I found her definition of ""Tolerance"" to be very enlightening.

For the most part, Ms. Bruce makes an excellent case that the Left has gone off the deep end. After a while those she begins to sound like a conspirisy theorist. Everything is a plot, even things that aren't. What I wanted to hear was how she justufies her Lesbian, Pro-choice stance in the context of her obviously conservative views.

As a polemic it starts out as entertaining, provocative, even interesting. It wears thin quickly however. A point becomes a rant and in the end I found the rant unsustainable. There is no point to this book except as one tiresome arguement that the 'liberal left' is the cause of all that is wrong in our society. A bit of critical reflection tells us that it isn't that simple. Nothing is. If you take the binary view of life, that everything can be reduced to black and white morality with no gray areas, this is your book. For people seeking informed and balanced social criticism, I would urge you to search elsewhere. I found this is a huge waste of time.

Super book, I don?t agree with her pro-choice stand, or her ?life style? but the book opened my eyes and caused my mouth to drop open in amazement! She nails down the ?far? lefts agenda and sheds light on their activities targeting our youth. A must book for those who think of them self as liberal and or conservative.

This is very well done. Tammy Bruce is a very intelligent woman. Sad that she is still gay after all that she knows now but she really doesn't parce words. Very interesting and gave me information I didn't know before. I am really glad I listened to this book.

In my opinion this is homophobic twaddle of the most ignorant kind. Everyone would go rightfully crazy if this site published racist or ant-semitic books, but somehow it is always OK to publicise prejudice against Lesbians and Gay men. Disgusting.

Twenty patients treated with 26 Pemberton osteotomies with allograft bone wedges were retrospectively evaluated radiographically.

Osteotomies all united radiographically within 3 months. The acetabular index improved from 33 degrees before surgery to 18 degrees after surgery, and the lateral migration index improved from 60% to 26%.

"During his King of the Dot battle against Loe Pesci in 2013, Daylyt put his hands down the front of his pants and appeared to fondle his genitals for a few seconds. He then turned to his opponent, Pesci, and wiped his hand on the side of his face and the top of his head. Many criticized Loe Pesci for not punching Daylyt for this act.

Recently, Loe Pesci appeared on the first episode of The Don’t Flop Show, a talk show created by Don’t Flop Entertainment, to discuss the Daylyt incident.

“It’s fucked up, man,” Loe Pesci says. “On the spot, when that shit happened, I was not expecting something like that to happen…He wants me to choke in the battle. He wants to throw me off. He wants me to swing on him so we get a million views and we on Worldstar and all that shit. So, I’m thinking…he wants to dictate the battle…The last thing he wants is me to spit these three rounds without fuckin’ up and unfazed. In a way, I don’t regret doing that because that’s what I showed up to do.”

Loe Pesci Says He Would Punch Daylyt If He Could Go Back To Their Battle

Loe Pesci says he did not choose to punch Daylyt because he never felt his security was in question during the match-up, but says he has other thoughts about it now.

“After the battle happened, everybody was like, ‘How come you didn’t swing on him?'” Loe Pesci says. “It was a split-second decision. Do you shut down the event, punch this guy in the face and throw out these three rounds? I actually spent more time writing for this battle than I have on other battles because I thought this battle would probably get more views or whatever…And I kind of rated Daylyt before this shit happened because on some personal shit, that’s some bullshit ’cause, reality-wise, I didn’t do nothing to deserve that. But things happen the way they do and you have to roll with the punches…If I could go back, I probably would swing on him because I’ve seen so many different peoples’ opinions that after that, people kind of see you differently. I don’t feel it makes more of a man for me to swing on him. I feel it actually takes more to not.”

Loe Pesci was one of four battlers profiled on the first episode of The Don’t Flop Show. He joined Caustic, Rone and Knamelis on the program, which is hosted by Eurgh.

There's a lot to learn when you first start editing Wikipedia, and it can be overwhelming to try to learn it all at once. It may be good to look at some high quality artistic biographies on Wikipedia, such as Bronwyn Bancroft or Dave Stamper to see how those articles do things. 
I've cleaned up your draft a lot. If you click """"View history"""" on the page, you can see the various changes that I made. For instance, with this edit I added several wikilinks. With this edit, I created an introductory sentence, so the reader can know instantly who she is and why she is important.
This next edit is very important: in it I changed the references to use  tags, so that individual statements are sourced. Notice how the first time I cite a source, I use the format url.com. When I later want to use the same reference, I only use the format . If you add more statements from these or other sources, you can reference them in the same way.
I made several other changes, which you can view in the history. I'm sure you'll want to add more information from these two references, and maybe from other references as well.

"Q:

Resolving HttpControllerContext with Castle Windsor

In the ASP.NET Web API, HttpControllerContext instances provide a lot of information about the current environment, including the URI of the current request.
If a service relies on such information (e.g. the request URI), it should be possible to inject that information into the service.
This is pretty easy to do using Poor Man's DI: just implement a custom IHttpControllerActivator.
However, with Castle Windsor this suddenly becomes very difficult. Previously, I've described a very convoluted way to resolve this issue, but it hinges on the PerWebRequest lifestyle, and it turns out that this lifestyle doesn't work in self-hosting scenarios, because HttpContext.Current is empty.
So far, I've been able to make this work by passing the desired information as an inline argument to the Resolve method from a custom IHttpControllerActivator:
public IHttpController Create(
    HttpControllerContext controllerContext,
    Type controllerType)
{
    var baseUri = new Uri(
        controllerContext
            .Request
            .RequestUri
            .GetLeftPart(UriPartial.Authority));

    return (IHttpController)this.container.Resolve(
        controllerType,
        new { baseUri = baseUri });
}

However, by default, this only works if the immediately requested type relies on the argument (i.e. if the requested Controller itself depends on the baseUri). If the dependency on baseUri is buried deeper in the dependency hierarchy, it doesn't work by default, because inline arguments aren't propagated to deeper layers.
This behavior can be changed with a custom IDependencyResolver (a Castle Windsor IDependencyResolver, not an ASP.NET Web API IDependencyResolver):
public class InlineDependenciesPropagatingDependencyResolver :
    DefaultDependencyResolver
{
    protected override CreationContext RebuildContextForParameter(
        CreationContext current, Type parameterType)
    {
        if (parameterType.ContainsGenericParameters)
        {
            return current;
        }

        return new CreationContext(parameterType, current, true);
    }
}

Notice that true is being passed as the propagateInlineDependencies constructor argument instead of false, which is the default implementation.
In order to wire up a container instance with the InlineDependenciesPropagatingDependencyResolver class, it must be constructed in this way:
this.container = 
    new WindsorContainer(
        new DefaultKernel(
            new InlineDependenciesPropagatingDependencyResolver(),
            new DefaultProxyFactory()),
        new DefaultComponentInstaller());

I'm wondering if this is the best solution to this problem, or if there's a better/simpler way?

A:

Just for the sake of completeness, an answer I got from Krzysztof Koźmic (the current maintainer of Castle Windsor) on Twitter indicated that the method outlined in the question is, indeed, the correct way of achieving this particular goal.
(However, I can't link to that tweet, since Krzysztof's twitter account is protected (tweets are not publicly visible.))

One is their failure to anticipate what’s coming and to plan for their potential care needs.

Second is the lack of efforts coming from the government, to provide affordable long term care options to residents of Hawaii.

My take on this issue is this, let’s not rely on the government’s programs to solve our long term care problems. Let’s take responsibility of our future needs by planning ahead and looking for affordable solutions.

"See today it is easy to be a racist.

All you have to do is hide behind a cause and use it as a red herring for how you really feel.

If you have not seen the sad, sad woman at a republican congressman's townhall meeting in Delaware, take a peek here. It is pathetic, lame and an excuse for these individuals to vent their real racist feelings.

See, I don't give a DAMN about folks running around here saying Barack Obama is not the legitimate president because he is not a citizen. His birth certificate was shown time and time again, in print, for you to download, in all the major newspapers and online, but still the urban legend continues. In fact, this tactic was used during the campaign and went no where, but the height, anger and raw emotion of the far, far, far right winged base of the Republican Party is something we need to be aware of. Why? Because they can not let it go.

When was the last time anyone questioned the last 43 presidents birth certificates, or if they were given ""is he really an American test?"" None of this was questioned because the last 43 were white men. But now with Obama this is brought up and with fervor now.

The reason this is bothersome is because after hearing Pat Buchanan's diatribe on Rachel Maddow's show, not only showed who he really is but makes many question why television have these people on? What Pat Buchanan said was racist through and through, yet, the responsibility of NBC/MSNBC has been moot.

Now we have the likes of Liz Cheney and Lou Dobbs stroking the hatred flame. This is dangerous.

Change was a word many of us wanted in the campaign, but along with policies was the reality that an African-American man was the change. And along with all of this is the real hatred of racism and bigotry that many have towards this man and his family at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

The birthers crowd won't win. They will continue to be laughed at, looked upon as a freak show. This will continue to be a noose around the Republicans neck, as they attempt to expand their stale, pale and male party. In the end, it is a negative for the Republican Party.

But as I close, as an African-American and a woman, it is very sad to have to witness, hear and read all the hate towards a man who won the presidency fair and square.

"Harlem's American Gangster

Harlem's American Gangster is the seventh mixtape by American hip hop recording artist Jim Jones released to digital retailers on February 19, 2008 under Koch Records. The album peaked at number three on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number one on the Top Rap Albums chart. The Koch CD was remixed and remastered from a limited edition release that came out the previous November. There was also a change in the track list, with some tracks added and others omitted. The mixtape is hosted by Dame Dash and features the entire ByrdGang crew. ""Love Me No More"" was released as a single but didn't reach any major Billboard charts.

Album information
Jim Jones explained to MTV why he chose to do the album,""The title of this mixtape is a bit controversial,"" Jim recently told Mixtape Monday about his response to Jay-Z's American Gangster. ""[Roc-A-Fella co-founder] Dame [Dash] feels the same way I do about American gangsters: If you snitch, you're not an American gangster. Understand me. That's what we're doing it for."" Dame actually crops up on the mixtape — he surfaces in the intro and in a series of skits — while Byrd Gang flagship member Max B did some co-writing. Don't miss ""Byrd Gang Money,"" ""Love Me No More"" and ""Up in Harlem.""

Track listing

Differences from the original release
The Koch release omitted ""Global Money Skit"", ""Two More Blocks"", ""Money Comes and Money Goes"", and ""Poverty"" from the ""unofficial"" version, and added ""Come on, Come On"", ""I Gotta Have It"", ""Lookin at the Game"", ""Rockefeller Laws"", and ""No Fuss"". Additionally, The Game does not appear on ""Love Me No More"" as he does on the ""unofficial"" version of the album.

"Have you ever noticed how leftwingers want a solution that allows Israel to exist safely, but also treats Palestinians with dignity as human beings with rights, and believe that both sides are too blame for not achieving this. At times the bulk of the blame had been on Palestinians, at other times (including recent decades) it had been on Israel.
What leftwingers want is for Israel and Palestine to do what South Africa did in the early 1990s and come to a negotiated settlement which ensures the rights of all the people there are protected. A two-state solution seems the most likely way to achieve that since Israelis are so set on the idea of an ethnic and religious homeland being a rigth, they must then offer Palestinians the same right.

One the other hand rightwing thought consists of ""Israel good, Muslims evil"".
And hence peace becomes impossible because that section of Israel which is racist and hateful has the entire global rightwing on their side. Try a little sophistication.",0,en,0

"As I read Paul in Romans, in his zeal to elevate the role of Christ to a sort of 'myth status'' as the source of 'life' and Grace, Paul goes back to a general impression of Genesis without checking what it actually said.

The essential error is that he says 'death is caused by sin'.
In our present English translations, what it says is that 'Adam' was created with death as an expectation. The myth writers knew that much.

To 'prevent' death, Adam would have had to eat -- and keep eating, presumably -- of the 'tree of life'. The 'sin' did not cause death -- it just got people expelled from the garden so they would have no access to the magic tree of life.",0,en,0

"1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to a rectifier station for a DC transmission which includes a rectifier bridge with a control system.
More particularly, the invention relates to protecting devices for overvoltages which may occur when the rectifier is started and controlled towards a so-called ""open"" line, that is, a line that is broken so that it does not conduct any current, either due to a fault on the line itself, or which is more common, due to a fault in the inverter station connected to the line. Since no current flows in the line, the rectifier control will control the rectifiers towards the smallest delay angle and thus the maximum voltage. As a consequence of a failing line current, a so-called top rectification will occur, that is, charging of the capacitances of the line to a voltage corresponding to the amplitude value of the alternating voltage without the voltage smoothing which a current would lead to. To this is to be added the voltage reflection on the line, which is an inevitable result of the open line. In particular in the case of cable transmissions which are very sensitive to overvoltages and also have great capacitances, such overvoltages place heavy demands on the discharge protection of the line.
2. The Prior Art
Instead of waiting for the discharge protectors to start operating, various solutions have been proposed to indicate overvoltages in time and to reduce the current of the rectifier, or at least limit its current increase.",0,en,0

"The Commonwealth Bank ups the ante on security

Sydney, 1 December 2009: The Commonwealth Bank has announced plans to further bolster its retail security systems including anti-skimming devices on ATMs as part of its bid to provide the most secure banking experience for customers.

The Bank has outlined a number of new initiatives designed to provide customers with a greater sense of safety and comfort when transacting.

“In the current climate one of the key issues for customers is security and protection of their finances and personal banking information. We continually look at our security systems across all of our customer channels and have identified a number of ways that we can further safeguard our customers, their money and their information,” Group Executive Retail Banking Services Ross McEwan, said.

Mr McEwan outlined a number of new initiatives currently being rolled out by the Commonwealth Bank including:

Two factor identification for online card and NetBank transactions; and

Continued roll-out of “Chip Authentication” on credit and debit cards, making card payments more secure.

“The anti-skimming devices are a significant security investment for the Bank and will assist in preventing fraudulent activity. We have been piloting these systems and are implementing them across the Bank’s ATM network,” said Mr McEwan.

“For would-be criminals the new anti-skimming devices will not be visible which may also assist in apprehending perpetrators,” he said.

Mr McEwan said the Bank had also recently bolstered its credit card fraud notification system so that customers are contacted even more quickly should any potentially suspicious transactions occur on their account.

“We continually monitor credit card transactions of customers to identify unusual or potentially fraudulent activity. With the introduction of the voice activated Adeptra telephone alert system, we can now contact customers within seconds of any potentially fraudulent activity,” he said.

Mr McEwan said the system triggers an automated call to the customer to ascertain the legitimacy of a recent transaction via a pre-recorded script followed by prompts to follow for further action where required.

“While this does not completely eradicate fraudulent activity, it does ensure that accounts can be shut down quickly to limit the impact on the customer, and allow remediation action to begin quickly and efficiently to return customers’ funds.”

Mr McEwan said the Bank is committed to continuously improving security for customers.

“Fraudsters and thieves are unfortunately becoming more and more sophisticated and bold in their methods and we are committed to investing whatever we need to in order to stay ahead of their game.”

"But I digress. It's said of Ronn Torossian that he represents ""right-wing"" Israeli politicians, but this description does not do his clients justice. ""Right-wing"" is Bibi Netanyahu. Torossian represents the lunatic fringe. Several years ago, in one of my only encounters with him, he introduced me to Benny Elon, a rabbi and settler leader who was then Israel's tourism minister, and who, at various points in his career, has more or less advocated the ethnic cleansing of Israel of its Arab citizens. At one point, when Elon had gone to take a telephone call, Torossian and I started talking about Israel's right to reprisal for terrorist attacks. I was arguing in favor of some sort of proportionality (this was after Jenin, in which the Israeli army chose to root out terrorism block by block rather than bomb the city from the air) but Torossian interrupted: ""I think we should kill a hundred Arabs or a thousand Arabs for every one Jew they kill."" I was somewhat taken aback, of course, because this is a Nazi idea, rather than a Jewish idea. I asked him to explicate: ""If someone from a town blows himself up and kills Jews, we should wipe out the town he's from, kill them all. The Israelis are suckers. They should have destroyed Jenin."" He went on like this for some time. I would only note that Torossian, to the best of my knowledge, never volunteered for the Israeli army, so he seemed to me by definition a chickenhawk.

Torossian's attitude toward Arabs and toward the peace process are echoed in the approach of Aish HaTorah, which is just about the most fundamentalist movement in Judaism today. Its operatives flourish in the radical belt of Jewish settlements just south of Nablus, in the northern West Bank, and their outposts across the world propagandize on behalf of a particularly sterile, sexist and revanchist brand of Judaism. Which is amusing, of course, because ""Obsession"" is meant to expose a particularly sterile, sexist and racist brand of Islam.



The tragedy of ""Obsession"" is not that it is wrong; the tragedy is that it takes a serious issue, and a serious threat -- that of Islamism -- and makes it into a cartoon. Its central argument is that the ""Islamofascism"" of today is not only the equivalent of Nazism, but worse than Nazism. This is quite a thing for a Jewish organization to argue. One of the featured speakers in ""Obsession"" is a self-described ""former PLO terrorist"" named Walid Shoebat, who argues on film that a ""secular dogma like Nazism is less dangerous than Islamofascism is today.""

This is lunacy, of course. Islamism isn't Nazism. It's bad enough without being labeled Nazism. Martin Gilbert, the biographer of Churchill, shows up in the film as well, and doesn't cover himself in glory: ""History has an unfortunate habit of always repeating itself,"" he says. Always? Does this mean that the Arabs are right now constructing death camps for the Jewish citizens of Israel?",1,en,1

"Electrostatic chucks are used to hold semiconductor wafers and other substrates during processing such as plasma etching. An electrostatic chuck (ESC) uses an electrostatic potential to hold (clamp) a substrate in place during processing. By clamping the substrate to the chuck, a high thermal conductivity gas such as helium (He) may be disposed between the substrate and the chuck in order to improve heat transfer between the substrate and the chuck. The substrate is removed from the ESC by lift pins and a transfer arm removes the substrate from the processing chamber.
A difficulty that arises with the use of an ESC is the need for removal of the residual electrostatic force between the substrate and the chuck in order to remove the substrate from the chuck. This residual force results from the accumulation of electric charge at the interface between the substrate and the ESC support surface. Several techniques have been developed for removing or de-chucking a substrate. For example, the electrode can be grounded or, alternatively, the polarity of the chucking voltage applied to the electrode can be reversed in order to discharge the electrode. However, these techniques are not completely effective at removing all the charge on the electrode and the substrate. A mechanical force is often required to overcome the residual attractive electrostatic force, which can damage the substrate or create difficulty in retrieving the substrate from an unintended position. Further, undesired particles can be generated during the substrate dechucking and removal process which contaminate the processed substrate.
Despite the developments to date, there is an interest in apparatus and methods which reduce any voltage potential spike during dechucking of processed substrates.",0,en,0
"Well, if there are going to be wacky items put into a new deal, how about we control the amount of oil we sell to stay in balance?  So, with both economies growing the price of oil goes up & puts the US into trade deficit.  So we cut back our oil exports.  Energy prices in the US now continue to rise as they need another source.  Maybe we have to cut back more (remember we are getting the same money but for less oil so it is not so terrible for Canada in that regard).  US economy starts to sputter due to high energy prices and purchases less in general from Canada.  Not good for other parts of the economy.  Can we then sell more oil to fill the gap?  Not sure as we might be buying less from the US as our non-oil portion of the economy tanks.  Perhaps we then sell the same oil domestically at a lower price helping Canadian industry?  Nice idea, but we don't have any refineries & seem to think we don't need any.  Nope, the whole idea looks wacky and not good for Canada",0,en,0

"By Tristan Kasinger

As quite literally anyone who is anyone in the progressive twitter-verse knows, #UniteBlue is kind of a big deal. Whether you are a champion for #UniteBlue or one of the quickly shrinking “Blue Birthers” who question the motives of UB’s diabolical actions, everyone on the Left (and quite a few trolls on the Right) are talking about this movement.

As with everything I say here and on my my twitter , this is my opinion on what I honestly think is one of the stupidest and most childish conversations between liberals that I have ever witnessed.

A bit of background for my two readers who don’t know anything about #UniteBlue : It is both a “Hashtag” (a kind of Twitter chat room) and a support website/Twitter app . It was created by the Father-Son team of Adam and Zach Green, respectively, as a vehicle for those of us on the left to connect with each other and chat, debate and just plain chill with people who are like-minded. To any well-adjusted adult, this sounds like a good thing, right?

Apparently, no.

Enter Politicol News . This deceptively named website is a personal blog of an unknown number of anonymous writers who claim to care about the progressive cause. Glancing at their homepage, they look like one of the many independent progressive news sources out there, but if you dig deep in there you will run across plenty of incredibly one-sided attack articles aimed directly at Adam and Zach. If you read those links, which I really don’t expect you to do (honestly I had a hard time wading through them myself), you’ll notice something strangely missing: any info from Adam or Zach themselves.

hour and a half long where Zach gets grilled about every thing you could ever want to know about his past activism. The thing that is especially mind boggling is that if you simply Google “ Zach+Green+Interview+Unite+Blue ,” you’ll find quite a few articles from real lefty news sites that have contacted the Greens themselves, regardless of the final judgment of the article writers, and gotten their side of the story. What is more, the sixth result on that page is a large Q&A put up by Zach himself all about the “controversy,” answering all the questions that Politicol never actually asked him. There is also a Google+ Hangout that is anwhere Zach gets grilled about every thing you could ever want to know about his past activism.

The final nail in the coffin for the anti-Uniteblue crowd is this: if the worst-case scenario is true and the Greens are secret agents from the GOP, they are doing the worst job possible. If the GOP wants to influence the Left in any way (and I’m sure they do), I seriously doubt that even they are stupid enough to try and divide us by first bringing us all together.

There are literally pages and pages of this All of this back and forth has gone on for almost a month now. I’ve mostly stayed out of it because lately I’ve been trying the whole “Don’t feed the trolls” tactic. I tweeted a couple of support tweets aimed at Zach, but aside from that I haven’t engaged his detractors at all. However, rather than slowly dissipating as less and less people care about what Politicol has to say, the people who are left over have turned into a small group of very angry, very aggressive “truthers” who are convinced that Zach Green is a GOP puppet. @Politicolnews and their ilk spend almost the entire day tweeting #Uniteblue members and either calling them Sheeple and drug-addicts or sending them links to various articles (all on Politicolnews, of course) about all the evils of #UniteBlue. They insult the people they talk to and block their targets if any facts are brought to play. You can see a few of the tweets to the left, or if you are feeling particularly daring or masochistic, you can go to their Twitter Account and read their hate in real time. You can also catch them in action claiming Zach sent Peacock Panache, a progressive website that I contribute to, after their “news” site for just “asking them questions.”

why are you fighting with those of us in #UniteBlue with religious fervor? I don’t understand why you can’t say “You know what, I don’t agree with the founders of move on with your life. There are so many things we should all be focusing on (Hello, So all of this said, I have a question for anyone who is anti-Uniteblue: if what you are so worried about is the GOP breaking the Left up and causing us to fight amongst ourselves,? I don’t understand why you can’t say “You know what, I don’t agree with the founders of #UniteBlue and I don’t want to be a part of it. Have a good day,” and then. There are so many things we should all be focusing on (Hello, Monsanto Protection Act ) rather than arguing with a bunch of angry children who refuse to see any facts except the ones that support their arguments.

Async I/O for Python 3  - amirhhz

Sigh, another Async framework.

Yes it has nice features such can replace the reactor/hub thing. Has
futures/promises/deferreds. That has all been done before in Twisted. Yields
are cute and there was monocle, I wouldn't say it exactly took off :
<https://github.com/saucelabs/monocle>

Twisted has inlineCallbacks that use yields as well. Just import Twisted into
stdlib then and use that.

I am surprised that gevent was dismissed. Ok, there is also eventlet, if
someone doesn't like gevent. Monkey patching is scary? Is it really _that_
scary? Most sane and portable IO code probably runs on that today. Why?
Because there is no need to create a parallel world of libraries. Write a test
does it pass? Does it handle your use case? I'll take not knowing if my green
threads switch tasks and add another green thread lock, instead of doubling my
code size with yields, callbacks and futures.

Let's talk about Twisted (sorry couldn't resist WAT video reference). I
remember for years searching for parallel libraries to parse exotic protocols.
Regular Python library is there, but no, can't use that, sorry. Gotta go find
or write one that returns Deferreds. You add a single Twisted module in your
code, good luck! -- it ripples all the way to the top through your API and you
are doomed being locked into the Twisted world forever.

When gevent and eventlet came around it was like a breath of fresh air. This
is what sane concurrent IO looks like in Python:

<http://eventlet.net/doc/examples.html>

My fear is that many will just say fuck it, I'll just use Go/Rust/Erlang for
IO bound concurrent problems.

It is nice having a benevolent dictator, except when he goes a little crazy,
then dictatorship doesn't sounds so much fun anymore.

~~~
hosay123
Sane is in the eye of the beholder.. gevent _looks_ nice, but I'd be very
diffident when it comes to actually supporting it in production. It monkey
patches the standard library and messes with CPython internals to achieve what
it does, infinitely increasing the chance it will conflict with some other
piece of code (for example, that bizarre ancient internal propriety library
you're using that started life in Fortran, etc)

In the case of async I'm glad to see a from scratch implementation for the
standard library. It's a weird area that necessitates some constructions that
there is no really standard Python style for. You only need to look at Twisted
and e.g. its method chaining to realize this stuff would need a thorough
sanity rework before it ever became standard anyway.

Also, most other implementations take the approach of building their own
little world. This is definitely true of Twisted. You write code for Twisted,
not for Python. Gevent at least doesn't suffer from this.

~~~
Ixiaus
I used gevent at first for a project that needed Async I/O and it worked
really well, but then I switched to Erlang and I realized how poor a choice
Python is for such tasks. The language really needs to be designed from the
start for it (like Go, Rust, Erlang &c... Haskell wasn't designed from start
for it but because of it's functional purity, bolting it on was ""natural"" but
- it isn't so for Python IMHO).

~~~
craigyk
Yeah, if you're going to have to do async to be performant than it better be
pretty pervasive throughout all the libraries. Bonus points if the language
supports syntax to make async easier as well. Node is beating out Python for
server stuff not simply because it is ""async"", but because it is so much
FASTER. The speed of V8 vs. CPython is a big part of that. In fact, vanilla JS
doesn't have much to make async programming particularly easy: it has verbose
function declaration and no yield mechanisms. Even library-level solutions
like promises are merely 'OK'.

Still, it is easier to build a fast server that can handle streams in Node
than it is in Python. Async Python? I'll just stick to async JS in that case.

~~~
rdtsc
I think there is another issue here. Python world has watched as Node.js has
been eating its lunch on the server side and they decided, ah, surely that is
because Node.js has async, if we add that too, everyone will love Python again
and come crawling back. They are not saying, I think that is written between
the lines.

Except one thing, as you pointed out, people use Node.js -- 1) it is JS 2) V8
is fast.

~~~
nashequilibrium
The reason why you getting so many downvotes is because your comment is not
just silly but flat wrong. Twisted, Tornado were around before nodejs. There
are also async frameworks that make writing async code the same as synchronous
code. I like tornado but I am using nodejs for my current app because of the
libraries. This is where nodejs really shines, the community and libraries are
awesome. Twisted has a lot of libraries but it has so much going on that many
developers find it too complex. Tornado is a much simpler async framework to
adapt to and allows you to run twisted libraries.

Twisted's inlinecallback's and tornado's gen module gets rid of all the async
spaghetti code. This is hard to do with nodejs but I still chose nodejs
because the available libraries made my project quicker to develop.

~~~
rdtsc
Sorry I didn't express myself correctly (see my reply to akuchling below).

Basically yes, Python had Twisted for years, it had Diesel, Monocle, Tornado,
and some other ones. I am aware of those and as you've read my comment you saw
that I used Twisted enough to know its ins and outs (5 years).

> There are also async frameworks that make writing async code the same as

Yes there is inlineCallbacks and I used. Node.js also has async
(<https://github.com/caolan/async>). But you don't address the main problem
that I raised -- fragmentation of libraries. Python is great because it comes
with batteries, and then you can find even more batteries everywhere, _except_
if you use an async framework like Twisted, which, percolates all the way
through you API code. Once your socket.recv() returns a Deferred(), that
deferred will bubble up all the way to the user interface. So you now you end
up searching or recreating a parallel set of libraries.

> Twisted has a lot of libraries but it has so much going on that many

It is too complex with too many libraries for those who want to take it up but
it is not complex and doesn't have enough libraries if you are in it already
-- every library you use has to be Twisted now. That's the danger of inventing
a new framework.

Yes it will be standard, but there is already a practical standard -- eventlet
and gevent. This is somethin Node.js doesn't have. I will personally take
monkey-patching and the danger that my function will context switch inside
while doing IO over using Twisted. I saw a practical benefit from it at least.

~~~
cpprototypes
I have a question for you since you have a lot of experience with async.
Eventually node.js will have generators (when V8 implements ECMAScript 6)
which should allow node.js to have something like gevent. What kind of effect
do you think this will have on the node.js world?

~~~
rdtsc
If it has generators it will make it easier. I remember being happy about
finding out Twisted has inlineCallbacks. I basically let you not have to split
your logical function into multiple functions simply because it has to to do
some IO.

Before it used to be code like:

    
    
        def processShoppingCart(...):
           d.addCallback(_cb1)
           return d # (d is a Deferred)
    
       def _cb1(...):
          d2.addCallback(_cb2)
          return d2 # d2 is a another Deferred
    

etc.

Which with generators and inlineCallbacks turns into

    
    
        @someDecoratorThatEnableUsingInlineCallbacks
        def processShoppingCart(...):
           .. do some work ..
           yield <some_io_function_like_check_db>
           .. do some more work ..
           yield <some_io_other_io_function>
           ....
    

You get the idea. I am not too familiar with Node.js but I imagine it will
help quite a bit.

CoffeeDregs
Perhaps the video makes more clear the rationale. E.g.

    
    
      Possible solution: ""Standardizing gevent solves all its problems"". 
      One of the responses: ""I like to write clean code from scratch"".
      Another: ""I really like clean interfaces"".
    

So I'd prefer that the BDFL work with the gevent folks to get it cleaned up
and integrated while adjusting it to expose a ""clean interface"".

Perhaps the whole thing will make more sense once Guido provides more detail,
but I'm underwhelmed and confused.

~~~

I find that unlikely: Guido doesn't like gevent.

Though yes, it's a nice thought.

~~~
fzzzy
Guido has been resisting the stackless stack slicing assembly technique since
I first learned about Python and Stackless Python in 1999. That's obviously
never going to change.

~~~
rdtsc
That reminds me of one of those famous Roman Emperors that all is well and
good as well as they make rational decisions, then eventually they turn senile
or mad, and everyone realizes how dictatorship is not that much fun sometimes.

~~~
fzzzy
From a certain perspective it is a rational decision. Because the CPython API
relies so heavily on the C stack, either some platform-specific assembly is
required to slice up the C stack to implement green threads, or the entire
CPython API would have to be redesigned to not keep the Python stack state on
the C stack.

Way back in the day [1] the proposal for merging Stackless into mainline
Python involved removing Python's stack state from the C stack. However there
are complications with calling from C extensions back into Python that
ultimately killed this approach.

After this Stackless evolved to be a much less modified fork of the Python
codebase with a bit of platform specific assembly that performed ""stack
slicing"". Basically when a coro starts, the contents of the stack pointer
register are recorded, and when a coro wishes to switch, the slice of the
stack from the recorded stack pointer value to the current stack pointer value
is copied off onto the heap. The stack pointer is then adjusted back down to
the saved value and another task can run in that same stack space, or a stack
slice that was stored on the heap previously can be copied back onto the stack
and the stack pointer adjusted so that the task resumes where it left off.

Then around 2005 the Stackless stack slicing assembly was ported into a
CPython extension as part of py.lib. This was known as greenlet. Unfortunately
all the original codespeak.net py.lib pages are 404 now, but here's a blog
post from around that time that talks about it [2].

Finally the relevant parts of greenlet were extracted from py.lib into a
standalone greenlet module, and eventlet, gevent, et cetera grew up around
this packaging of the Stackless stack slicing code.

So you see, using the Stackless strategy in mainline python would have either
required breaking a bunch of existing C extensions and placing limitations on
how C extensions could call back into Python, or custom low level stack
slicing assembly that has to be maintained for each processor architecture.
CPython does not contain any assembly, only portable C, so using greenlet in
core would mean that CPython itself would become less portable.

Generators, on the other hand, get around the issue of CPython's dependence on
the C stack by unwinding both the C and Python stack on yield. The C and
Python stack state is lost, but a program counter state is kept so that the
next time the generator is called, execution resumes in the middle of the
function instead of the beginning.

There are problems with this approach; the previous stack state is lost, so
stack traces have less information in them; the entire call stack must be
unwound back up to the main loop instead of a deeply nested call being able to
switch without the callers being aware that the switch is happening; and
special syntax (yield or yield from) must be explicitly used to call out a
switch.

But at least generators don't require breaking changes to the CPython API or
non-portable stack slicing assembly. So maybe now you can see why Guido
prefers it.

Myself, I decided that the advantages of transparent stack switching and
interoperability outweighed the disadvantages of relying on non-portable stack
slicing assembly. However Guido just sees things in a different light, and I
understand his perspective.

Thank you for the providing all the background! I didn't know all the
historical context.

> or custom low level stack slicing assembly that has to be maintained for
> each processor architecture.

Yeah I would personally also say that the advantages of writing the equivalent
assembly for a handful of architectures outweigh re-writing / re-inventing
high level library code dealing with concurrent IO.

I think Guido and a few others have decided to focus on some things rather
than others and the Python ecosystem will suffer in the long run based on
these decision. The ability to write beautiful concurrent IO code without a
whole new async framework, is better, even if means breaking some C
extensions, writing assembly, or not supporting exotic CPUs.

Programming world is not going to get less concurrent over time. Concurrency
will spread more and more. There is already some momentum with gevent and
eventlet and it is something that Node.js doesn't have -- and I see Guido
turning away and making something worse.

As Guido mentions, @coroutine/yield from is very similar to C#'s async
implementation (with some differences like type safety).

Since Guido has the barest of descriptions on how this works, you may find the
C# async description useful. [1]

Just to check if I'm understanding the presentation right, will the
implementation involve compiler magic to turn this:

    
    
        @coroutine
        def getresp():
            s = socket()
            yield from loop.sock_connect(s, host, port)
            yield from loop.sock_sendall(s, b'xyzzy')
            data = yield from loop.sock_recv(s, 100)
            # ...
    

into this, similar to how C# does it? (let's pretend multi-line lambdas exist
for a minute)

    
    
        def getresp():
            s = socket()
            loop.sock_connect(s, host, port).add_done_callback(lambda:
                loop.sock_sendall(s, b'xyzzy').add_done_callback(lambda:
                    data = loop.sock_recv(s, 100).add_done_callback(lambda:
                        # ...
                    )
                )
            )
    

Or will the `yield from`s bubble up all the way to the event loop and avoid
the need for that?

~~~
rdtsc
No magic there.

It is Eventlet and Gevent have that magic. Here is how that looks:

    
    
        def getresp():
            s = socket()
            s.connect((host,port))
            s.sendall(s,b'xyzzy')
            data = s.recv(s,100)
    
    

Compare that to any of the above. This is what is thrown away in favor of
'yield from' and @coroutine mess coupled with a completely parallel set of IO
libraries.

~~~
fzzzy
Well... There actually are a completely parallel set of IO libraries, it just
happens that the interface can be identical to the existing blocking
interfaces because of the greenlet stack slicing magic... So it only appears
like there are not a completely parallel set of IO libraries.

But that's just a nitpick.

~~~
rdtsc
> So it only appears like there are not a completely parallel set of IO

Right on. That's the great part -- both a simple way to program and re
usability of libraries.

So far, I see library ecosystem fragmentation as the biggest issue of all and
nobody seems to want to talk to it.

Academically all the yields and co-routines look so cool, in practice when you
need 5 libraries to help with some task, and now you have to re-write them --
not so cool.

""...run code in another thread - sometimes there is no alternative - eg.

Just thought I'd mention that async-supporting DNS libs do exist (eg. gevent
ships with C-ares), and in particular I've used async postgres database
connections in both C and gevent. The code to gevent-ise psycopg2 connections
is about 10 or 15 lines, iirc.

> The code to gevent-ise psycopg2 connections is about 10 or 15 lines, iirc.

Because psycopg2 has supported async OOTB since 2.2 by exposing a pollable
socket: [http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/advanced.html#asynchronous-

There are limitations though, as noted by the docs: COPY and LOs don't work.

Reading that presentation, it seems that Python has way too many Asyncronous

as a chance).

I really wonder why that is not the case in Ruby. I mean there are some, but
there's mostly confidential and there doesn't seem to be much interest around
them. Especially not to the point that the project leader would take a stab at
it.

Can I place 3D geometry objects in a JavaFXCollection?

I have a few 3D geometrical objects like sphere, Tube, Cube etc. I am generating using usual way of using classes like Sphere, Cylinder,Box etc inside FXML based-menu in a FXMLcontroller. This means object box1 is local to @FXMLmakeCube sort of method.
Now I wish to perform few operations like boolean operation, copy, mirroring etc. in another method inside this controller. I want to keep all created geometries in JavaFXCollection sort of List so that I may call the handle to those geometries from inside any other method.
My question is how can I do this? How can I refer this handles in other method inside the same FXMLController?
I did not find exact question in the net.

A:

You can place all those 3D objects in one collection, since all of them extend from Shape3D.
You can create an ObservableList<Shape3D> collection, and add each object to it when you create them. Then you can listen to changes in the collection, and add to the scene/subscene all the new objects.
This would be a sample of a controller with four buttons, where you can create random Box or Sphere 3D objects, add them to the collection, and place them in a subscene. 
Also you can perform operations with the full collection (translate or rotate them in this case).

That the good and humble from the country, the peasants so to speak, had much greater principles and honor and thus prevailed. 



If there is to be a revolution in America, the tree of liberty to be refreshed as Jefferson put so well, I do hope as much as I disagree with just about everything concerning Chairman Mao, that his proud boast which I spoke of, should be here as well. The cities and colleges of America are liberal cesspools of discontent, they oppose freedom without even realizing what they are destroying. Speech is free from their violence only if they agree with what's being said. Sad.

"Pathological gambling: an update on neuropathophysiology and pharmacotherapy.
Neurobiological research has shown the potential involvement of serotonergic, dopaminergic and opioid dysfunction in the pathophysiology of pathological gambling. In this review, we present current theories of the neuropathology of pathological gambling, paying particular attention to the role of the neural circuitry underlying motivation, reward, decision-making and impulsivity. This review also presents a literature review of current pharmacological treatment strategies for pathological gambling, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), opioid receptor antagonists, anti-addiction drugs and mood stabilizers, and also discusses the role of nonpharmacological interventions.A hypothetical model of the clinical subtypes of pathological gambling is presented, e.g. the impulsive subtype, the obsessive-compulsive subtype and the addictive subtype. This model attempts to integrate current knowledge in the field of pathological gambling regarding neuropathology, psychiatric co-morbidity, family history, genetics, course of illness, gender and response to pharmacological treatment. Finally, it is proposed that the existence of possible clinical subtypes of pathological gambling may provide a potential framework for matching the various subtypes with specific pharmacotherapies.",0,en,0
So you are satisfied with the way Lisa has been locked into the obstructionist McConnell strategy Frank? There's no way in hell that any of the progressive agenda Bernie championed and that was included in the Democratic Party platform will be brought to fruition if Dem/Indies don't control the Senate. There's no way the Supreme Court will ever be filled with more liberal judges than Garland without the Dems/Indies taking back control of the Senate. There's no way Citizens United will be ever repealed or reversed in the SCOTUS without Dems/Indies taking back the Senate.

"Menopausal symptoms in women treated for breast cancer: the prevalence and severity of symptoms and their perceived effects on quality of life.
To determine, first, the prevalence and severity of various symptoms related to estrogen deficiency in women within a few years of receiving treatment for breast cancer, second, how women perceive the effects of these symptoms on their quality of life and, third, what measures have been taken to relieve vasomotor symptoms. Two hundred women (aged 29-65 years) who had received treatment for breast cancer within the last 5 years were included in this cross-sectional survey. Information was collected about their breast cancer treatment, menopausal symptoms (Menopausal Rating Scale), the perceived effects of menopausal symptoms on their and their partner's quality of life and any treatments they were receiving for hot flushes. All but one woman reported at least one symptom related to the menopause (95.9% vasomotor; 83.3% psychological; 89.7% somatic). Current treatment with tamoxifen or previous chemotherapy did not influence the prevalence or the severity of hot flushes. Current antidepressant treatment was, however, significantly associated with a higher prevalence and severity of most menopausal symptoms, including hot flushes and sweats (p = 0.008). The severity of hot flushes and sweats was significantly correlated with self-assessed effects on overall quality of life (r(s) = 0.47); 56.4% of the respondents believed that menopausal symptoms had affected their partner's quality of life, the strongest correlations being with severity of sexual symptoms (r(s) = 0.56) and vaginal dryness (r(s) = 0.5). Only 21% of women experiencing hot flushes were receiving any treatment for hot flushes, with most women describing no knowledge or poor knowledge of treatment options. The majority of women receiving treatment for breast cancer report menopausal symptoms, which negatively correlate, not only with their own, but also with their partner's quality of life. Most women experiencing hot flushes are not receiving treatment due to lack of both awareness and confidence in the existing treatment options.",0,en,0

"He asserted that Schumer ""would rather have our Country fail with drugs & Immigration than give Republicans a win. But he gave Mexico bad advice, no bluff!""

""Can you imagine Cryin’saying out loud, for all to hear, that I am bluffing with respect to putting Tariffs on Mexico. What a Creep,"" Trump wrote in a tweet.

called Senate Minority Leader(D-N.Y.) ""a creep"" on Tuesday after the Democratic leader predicted the president would back down from slapping new tariffs on Mexico.

Can you imagine Cryin’ Chuck Schumer saying out loud, for all to hear, that I am bluffing with respect to putting Tariffs on Mexico. What a Creep. He would rather have our Country fail with drugs & Immigration than give Republicans a win. But he gave Mexico bad advice, no bluff!

Trump's tweet came after Schumer predicted earlier Tuesday that the president wouldn't move forward with his promise to slap new financial penalties on Mexico unless it cracks down on illegal immigration into the United States.

Schumer, speaking from the Senate floor, characterized the new tariffs as another example of Trump's ""whimsical and erratic proposals.""

""President Trump has a habit of proposing asinine and dangerous policies before backing off. And President Trump has a habit of pretending that the very act of not following through on a misguided policy is somehow a victory. So, I wouldn't be surprised at all if President Trump doesn't follow through on these tariffs either,"" Schumer said.

He added that Trump's decision to slap tariffs on Mexico would be ""massively destabilizing"" to both the U.S. and Mexican economies and that it would increase the number of immigrants trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.

Schumer doubled down on his prediction during a separate press conference on Tuesday, saying Trump would realize ""what a dumb move he's made.""",1,en,1

"Even Max Boot realizes that shooting down Russian jets over Syria is too reckless to be tried, so he goes looking for some other war that the U.S. can make worse:

Supplying arms to the Ukrainians will increase the pain of Putin’s Ukrainian offensive and divert his attention away from Syria.

It seems to have escaped the notice of hawks here in the U.S., but the cease-fire in Ukraine has largely been holding for many weeks, so their demand that the U.S. send arms to Ukraine is even more irresponsible than it was when they first started making it. Arming Ukraine was a lousy idea when the fighting was still going on, but now that there is a better chance to secure peace it is even worse.

Supposing that the administration were stupid enough to do as Boot recommends, it would only be able to divert Russian attention away from Syria if it led to a new Ukrainian offensive to inflict more “pain” on Moscow (i.e., kill more Russians and their proxies). That would in turn ensure that the conflict in Ukraine worsens to the much greater detriment of Ukraine. To the extent that arming Ukraine “succeeds” in doing this, it would mean that many more Ukrainians would be killed for the sake of distracting Russia from its latest misadventure. It’s not clear how anyone would benefit from this, and it would force Ukraine to endure additional losses for no good reason. It’s also possible that arming Ukraine wouldn’t have the desired effect, and might instead encourage Russia to become more combative and intransigent across the board. Except for perversely wishing to prolong and stoke a conflict that has been dying down, it is hard to see why anyone would now support such a measure.

The impulse to counter every Russian move with an opposing move is a common one among Western hawks, but especially in Ukraine and Syria it makes no sense. There is no particular reason why the U.S. needs to counter Russia’s intervention in Syria, and none of the proposed counter-moves serves American interests. In fact, the automatic reflex to seek to counter Russia allows Moscow to have more influence over our policies than it otherwise would.

"Mom Amber Rose Wears Sexy Clothes—Deal With It

There's no denying that Amber Rose is one hot mama. And she doesn't really care what anyone has to say about it.

The entrepreneur and mom to 3-year-old son Sebastian is known for the sexy skin-baring selfies she shares with her millions of followers on social media. And as she recently explained to People, despite the constant criticism, she has no plans to stop any time soon.

In fact, the model mama says she's proud of her body, and so she's raising son Sebastian to respect women, not objectify them. ""I'm his mother. My son is not looking at me,"" she said. ""Think about it, if you looked at your mom back in the day at Woodstock and she had on tiny little shorts and a midriff. You would say, 'Wow, Mom, you look dope!'""

Maybe. But having both a teen and a tween in the house, I can tell you from experience that when your kids reach a certain age they definitely start having some very concrete opinions about the moms who rock revealing clothing, most of them based around the phrase ""Just don't.""

But Rose has faith in Sebastian. ""When he's old enough, he's not going to look back at an old picture and say 'God, Mom, why were you dressing like a slut?'"" she explained. ""He's going to be like, 'Wow, Mom, you were gorgeous and now you're old!'""

I mean, we are all about body positivity so we'll play along. But just call us when he's 13, 'kay?

In the meantime, Rose is bringing back SlutWalk, the event and movement she started last year to fight social injustice and victim-blaming, after a Toronto police officer told a crowd of college women that if they wanted to avoid sexual assault, they shouldn't dress like sluts.

""I saw a picture of a girl that had on pasties and written on her chest it said, 'I'm Still Not Asking For It,'"" she told People. ""The point is you can wear whatever you want and it's not an invitation.""

So true!

Which is why Rose is perfectly at peace with all the haters who feel the need to leave nasty remarks about the way she dresses online. ""I don't care what anybody says,"" she said. ""I sleep like a baby at night when I see comments like that. Everybody else can talk sh*t- but my son won't.""",1,en,1

"The most recent research by Joseph Brennan, a media and communications lecturer at the University of Sydney, takes a methodical look at how gay porn studios advertise their performers' dicks. Published in the Journal of Homosexuality, it's the kind of work you might glance over before doing a double take, and realizing, yes, someone in a scholarly position actually combed through 6,900 dick pics ""for research.""

Of course, Brennan had a legitimate excuse: He wanted to see how porn performers were relegated to certain roles according to the size of their penises, and he found that those who fell into the lower range were marketed as bottoms. He also wanted to better understand how the marketing of donkey-size dicks affected the mental well-being of porn consumers.

""Beyond talk of the 'pornification' of gay culture or the mainstreaming of gay porn, I believe more simply that gay porn has played an historically important part in our community,"" Brennan says.

This fascination is fully on display in Brennan's scholarly trove. In addition to dick sizes, he's written about the gonzo aesthetic of gay porn like that produced by the (famously envelope-pushing, links NSFW) studio FraternityX. He's explored how performers who bareback have been ""discarded"" by the industry, catalogued reactions to ""abuse porn"" on the site Boys Halfway House, and looked at how porn sites like Czech Hunters play on Western gay fantasies of desperate and horny Eastern European men.

Brennan seems most intrigued by some gay porn consumers' darker impulses. Why do sites with graphic rape simulations and themes of exploitation seem to thrive online, and what, if anything, do they say about gay culture? In his paper about Boys Halfway House, a porn series in which the viewer sometimes assumes the identity of a predatory social worker, Brennan looks at how viewers make distinctions between ""good"" (stylized) and ""bad"" (uncomfortably realistic) abuse porn. There seems to be a fuzzy line that, when crossed, makes viewers feel like they're participating in rape culture. As one comment on a porn review blog reads, ""It's presenting rape as hot, when it completely isn't. It's a major problem in society and things like this are basically okaying it.""

""B_oys Halfway House_ is an example that brings us closer, I think, to what many might see as the limits of pornographic fantasy,"" says Brennan.

Similarly, in analyzing Czech Hunters, a gay-for-pay series set in Eastern Europe, he looked at another uncomfortably exploitative porn fantasy—that of the desperate straight man willing to do anything for a fat wad of cash. He argues that there's a kind of false nostalgia at play in the particular strain of narrative that Czech Hunters lays out; people want to believe that the Czech Republic had a thriving sex trade after the fall of Communism, filled with straight guys eager to earn a quick buck. It's an internationalization of the classic gay-for-pay scenario that relies on stereotypes about Eastern Europe.

Peering at gay porn through a monocle might seem like a rather obvious excuse to watch Sean Cody videos at the office, but there are plenty of reasons to do it. For one, research has shown that gay and bisexual men report greater body-related stress and anxiety, body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, and overall poorer body image than heterosexual men, likely due to the porn they consume. Other research has shown a correlation between consuming bareback porn and one's predilection toward risky sex. Then there are the untold masses of straight men and women who consume it, too. Needless to say, there's a lot to untangle about gay porn.

But while porn is a popular realm of study, it's been controversial from the get-go. Porn Studies only launched three years ago as the ""first dedicated, international, peer-reviewed journal to critically explore those cultural products and services designated as pornographic,"" and it was near-instantly decried by anti-porn activists.

Today, though, Brennan says there's a greater understanding for the value of the porn researcher. ""I see the number of scholars working in the gay porn area, and publishing on a regular basis, as a small-yet-devoted collective of talented people who approach the field from a number of disciplinary perspectives,"" he says. In 2015, for example, the journal Psychology and Sexuality released its first special issue on the subject of gay porn. Other publications, including Psychology & Sexuality, have also played host to the burgeoning world of gay porn scholarship.

In our interview, Brennan could be frustratingly obtuse about his motivations for studying porn, and you get the sense that this evasiveness comes with being a self-appointed dispassionate observer. He's careful not to judge the pornographic work itself but rather focus on the online chatter surrounding it.

But it's also clear he sees how the porn world reinforces stereotypes; in his piece on the penis sizes of performers, for example, he notes that tops are frequently described as masculine, aggressive, and take-charge, while bottoms are described as boyish, slutty, and even ""hysterical.""

It's good, he says, to question ""the presentation of narrowly defined sex roles within gay pornography.""

""There's a privileged alignment that connects action, power, and penetration with extraordinarily sized, masculine men."" Could it really hurt to ask for a ""greater variation of fantasies""?",1,en,1

Again, this is the whole CD – normally I’d cut a few joints out on account of my not being a major major fan of such and such a beat, but please, where else are you gonna get this shit but from your boy?

Overall, this is some shit to rock in your iPod/CD Player/tape deck/whatever. And once again, respect to the people who got you this shit – JR, J Period, and the man hisself, CL Smooth. Feel free to pass this around, link it up, blah blah. For more info on the project though, hit up www.shamanwork.com.
Next week: the beattape episode, aka the all instrumental episode. If you’re looking to get on board with some of these heavyweight-ass producers you’ve been seeing pop up here and there on the mixtape show, you best get your beats in quick snap.

Still on deck: the all-south episode, and some other bonus round level shit. If you got anything you think is up to par, holler…

Yeah, I can’t stress enough that this episode was made possible in a large (as in like 98%) part by JR and family. I’ve got some new material from them as well, so be on the lookout for that dropping pretty soon.

Awesome return by one of the best mc’s ever to grace the mic . Cant wait for the new album in July ….Keep your head up CL ….Just goes to prove on these beats that CL don’t need Pete as much as the other way around ….Pete rocks got his head somewhere dark and smelly….I will be buying CL new stuff like a shot

Back again peeping the site as usual. Yea, CL. If you read this, I’m nto large yet and I go back to NY (Mount Vernon and The Bronx) regularly. But if you ever need a cat that rhymes with precision (and cuts), hollar at me. You are one of my favorites and f I never make it to that mountain top, the one artist I want to say I rhymed on the mic with would be you.

The lyrical Norman Rockwell returns. The man can paint a picture on any beat. CL strolls in like he’s only been gone a day or two with his saddle in hand and begins to ride and break each and every one of these beats as if they were tailor made for him. What happened to having a verbal skill set like this?

"Speaking FRANK-ly About Jesus: Critique of alleged evidence of the historicity of Jesus of Nazareth.

(Ed. Note: This is the 20th post in Frank Zindler’s Speaking Frankly About Jesus blog which is dedicated to the thesis that Jesus of Nazareth never existed. This is part L of a mini series debunking “The Myth of the Mythical Jesus“.)

Lies: So short in stating, so long in negating!

Following up on Philip Jenkins’ blog “The Myth of the Mythical Jesus,” we plunge into his paragraph instructing us about “the fatuous objection” that Philo of Alexandria does not refer to Jesus:

“Just to illustrate how fatuous [Webster: complacently stupid or inane; silly; foolish; illusory; unreal] that objection is, Philo of Alexandria does not refer to Jesus, although he was working at the time. But why on earth would he have heard of such an affair in a neighboring land at the time, or thought it of the slightest significance, any more than a dozen other messianic claimants? And that would be even assuming the story had any relevance to anything he happened to be working on. Jesus did not matter to any elite writer at the time. As his followers grew in number, they did come to matter, and it is only at that point that non-Christian writers begin to pay any attention.”

Before engaging the overall argument of this paragraph, let me comment on a few glaring fallacies that hopefully by now my readers will have been able to spot by themselves. “Jesus did not matter to any elite writer at the time.” This presumes the existence of Jesus and is circular reasoning. Secondly, how could Jenkins know this? This is both an unsubstantiated claim and a meaningless, unsubstantiatable claim: there is no way to test it. Thirdly, who knows how many “elite writers” there were at the time? Again, a question that is meaningless because it is untestable.

“As his followers grew in number, they did come to matter.” At a superficial level, this is reasonable, but it could have been said equally of the followers of Mithra! This leads us to realize that we are dealing with a concealed circular argument: “As his followers grew in number” is presupposing the earthly existence of Jesus in a manner different from the identical phrase “as Mithra’s followers grew in number.”

Everyone knows (?) that Mithra was a mythical being, and so no logical seduction is involved there.

Now let’s get to the red meat and bare bones of Jenkins’ argument in this paragraph. “Just to illustrate how fatuous that objection [that no contemporary secular or non-Christian literary sources mention Jesus] is,” he writes, “Philo of Alexandria does not refer to Jesus, although he was working at the time [c25 BCE–c50 CE]. But why on earth would he have heard of such an affair in a neighboring land at the time, or thought it of the slightest significance…?”

Why don’t I tell the story of Philo Judaeus—Philo of Alexandria—so readers will be able to answer the “anxiousbench” blogger without further coaching?

“Philo the Jew” [c25 BCE–c50 CE] was an Alexandrian philosopher and theologian who tried to harmonize the Hebrew scriptures with Greek philosophy—especially Platonism—although he also seems to have been intimately influenced by Stoicism and Pythagorean thought. At the time, Alexandria in Egypt had the largest Jewish population outside of Judea, and the Alexandrian Jewish community was in active communication with the homeland. Alexandria was even more important than Athens or Rome as a center of learning of all sorts.

Philo himself had intimate ties to Jerusalem and Judea and we know that he visited the Temple of Yahweh himself at least once in his life [Prov. 2.64]. Jerusalem and Alexandria in Egypt were only about 500 miles apart by sea and short overland travel, and travel to and from Alexandria to all parts in the Mediterranean world was very efficient—albeit dependent upon seasonal winds and weather. In any case, communications between Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Rome were excellent for the time.

Philo had strong family ties to Judea. Through his brother Alexander, Philo had two nephews: Tiberius Julius Alexander and Marcus Julius Alexander. Marcus, be it known, was the first husband of the Herodian princess Bernice, the daughter of Herod Agrippa I! She is mentioned in the New Testament Acts of the Apostles:

“Acts 25:13. And after certain days King Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus. 14 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the King, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix: 15 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me; desiring to have Judgment against him [Paul the Apostle].” [Nota bene: Philo makes no mention of the ‘Apostle Paul either!] “Acts 25:23. And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul was brought forth. “Acts 26:30. And when he [Paul] had thus spoke the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them; 31 And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.” [One yearns to know how and by whom this “fact” was reported! If it had been reported by Bernice, surely she would have told her religious uncle as well as the author of Acts!]

Okay, so that’s Philo’s connection to Judea through his nephew Marcus Julius Alexander. His other nephew, Tiberius Julius Alexander renounced Judaism and became procurator of the Province of Judaea [46–48 CE] and Prefect of Egypt [66-70 CE]—the last four years of Philo’s life!

While Philo of Alexandria never mentioned Jesus of Nazareth or Saul/Paul the Apostle, he did have profound effect on the corpus of the New Testament and the origins of Christianity, as is now becoming evident. Eusebius thought that the monastic Therapeutae described by Philo were an early Christian community, and even made up the story that Philo had met Peter in Rome! (Eusebius is the likely forger of the interpolations into the text of the Jewish historian Josephus, of whom more anon.) Of course, Philo makes no mention of Peter, yet he has a detailed description of his trip to Rome—the so-called “Embassy to Gaius” (Caligula). So obviously essential to Christian theology were Philo’s ideas, St. Jerome (translator of the Latin Vulgate Bible) numbered him among the Church Fathers! (Philo’s voluminous works were transmitted not by his fellow Jews but by the Christian Church.)

But it gets yet better! Philonian philosophy as been perceived by some scholars in the writings of the Pauline authors, the Epistle to the Hebrews (R. Williams & H.W. Attridge) and, of course, the author of the prolog of the Gospel of John. It is in the latter document that the importance of Philo in the origins of Christianity is most astounding. Philo is the creator of the Platonic-Stoic concept of the Logos doctrine so central to both Orthodox Christianity and heterodox forms such as Gnosticism. Indeed, Philo can be argued to be responsible for the most otherworldly view of Jesus in the New Testament:

“John 1:1. In the beginning was the Word [logos] and the Word [logos] was with God, and the Word [logos] was God. 2 He [the logos] was in the beginning with God, 3 All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. 4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.”

This is redolent both of Platonic astrotheological mysticism and primitive Gnosticism. Philo’s logos-philosophy can, indeed, help to explain how both florid later Gnosticism as well as Orthodoxy could have evolved from a common bundle of traditions—something impossible to explain if both developed from a recently crucified man of flesh and blood, Jesus of Nazareth.

In the next installment we shall see how Jenkins tries to prove that the historian Flavius Josephus actually did mention Jesus and rescue (sort of) the infamous Testimonium Flavianum.

Hey everyone! I'm a complete newbie who got fed up with windows and thought I'd give this a shot. After a clean install, I can't get mintUpdate to do any updating. Here is what happened:

I just freshly installed Linux Mint, and after it booted up, I noticed that the icon in the toolbar says that there are 49 updates to install. When I click on it, mintUpdate hangs. Finally, after about 15 minutes, I got to the screen with the heading ""Keep your system up-to-date."" It showed no updates, so I clicked on refresh, and the window grayed out, and I watched the cursor spin for another 25 minutes, and nothing happens. Does this mean that everything is up to date? I really appreciate any help you can give me. Thanks in advance, and sorry if this is a dumb question.

Its not dumb, it's actually kind of puzzling, cause if you did a fresh install, there should be quite a few updates. What are you system specs, and when you burned the ISO, did you use the lowest speed? also, can you connect to the internet? This could be a few different things, so we need as much info as you can provide.

Thanks for the quick response! I burned the iso 4-5 days ago on the lowest possible speed. I have an MSI K9NGM4-F V.2 motherboard and an AMD Athlon 64 X2 5200+ with 2 gigs of RAM. Also, I thought I'd mention that to get the LiveCD to boot, I had to take out my wireless card, and run in graphic safe mode. I don't know if that is relevant, but other than that, the installation and everything with smoothly. If there is anything else you need to know to help, just let me know! Thanks!!

I get the same problem and have to disable the Medibuntu repo in the sources list as it is always locking up mintupdate. To check open a terminal and do a ""sudo apt-get update"". If it gets to the last line and gets stuck, just make a note of which repo you are having problems with and comment it out of your sources.list. Also it can stop mintinstall from working in the software portal.

I also noticed that the software portal does not work either. Same sort of situation, just locks up on ""backing up your APT sources.""

Press ALT+F2, then type ""gksu nautilus"" and enter your password. BE CAREFUL as you are now running nautilus as root. Navigate to /var/lib/apt/lists in the file system and find the file called ""lock"" and delete it.

"Personal View Of Soviet Jews Another View

""What the Russian Jews really want,"" was the title of an article by Gwynne Dyer published in The Morning Call on April 6.

Since not so long ago I was a Russian Jew myself I got really interested to find out what according to Mr. Dyer I really wanted.

What have I learned from this peculiar mixture of partial truth, ignorance and arrogance?

First, I have learned that 400,000 Jews want to leave the Soviet Union, ""but of course, most of them don't really want to go to Israel; they want to go to the United States,"" the columnist declares.

I guess, Gwynne Dyer has received this information firsthand from a public poll conducted by him among the potential emigrants in the Soviet Union.

There is an implied negativism in the article toward such desires of Russian Jews. Is there anything wrong if they do want to come to this great country? It does not seem strange for Gwynne Dyer, a Canadian syndicated journalist, to work in London and to publish his articles in America. Why not give the Russian Jews at least as much freedom in deciding their own fate? The issue is not where they want to go, this is for them to decide, but to be able to go.

Then I have learned that ""the Soviet government has allowed a measure of Jewish emigration on the grounds that these are profoundly religious people longing to join their coreligionists in Israel . . . . ""

Where is this coming from? KGB statistics?

If Mr. Syndicated Columnist would bother to open any Soviet newspaper he would quickly learn that the Soviet Union is an atheistic society. Most of Russian Jews are not religious and the Soviet government knows it very well. Russian Jews have always been the most oppressed minority which got a terrific boost to their national identity and their fight for freedom after the Arab- Israeli war of 1967.

Moscow does not make a ""phony exception"" for Jews based on their religion but because Jews are a very convenient currency which could be issued in small coins or large bills in exchange for some needed commodities. Moscow sometimes runs into snags with this currency game, like the Jackson amendment which Mr. Dyer labels as ""idiotic.""

I am one of many thousands of eternally grateful others who got out of Russia thanks to this amendment. There is something definitely idiotic in the columnist's article but it is not the late senator's amendment.

This however is not the end of Gwynne Dyer's discoveries. Here comes a real jewel: ""The Soviet state is not anti-Semitic. Soviet Jews do not suffer any special oppression, and Judaism is under no more severe constrains than any other religions . . . . ""

I wish Mr. Dyer could live just half a year as a Jew in the ""non-anti- Semit ic"" Soviet Union and would try to get a job, try to openly visit a synagogue if hewould find one, try to buy some matzos, try to speak aloud in Yiddish or Hebrew in a public place or sympathize with Israel, try to send his kids to a good college, etc.

Do you know that official Soviet propaganda equates Judaism, Zionism and fascism?

I wonder if Mr. Dyer has ever heard of the ""Jewish doctor's plot to kill Stalin""? Does he know that on May 9 - the Victory Day in Russia - Soviet propaganda never mentions Jewish war heroes as if they never existed? If this is not anti-Semitism I do not know what is.

At this point columnist Dyer turns to generalizations and recommendations.

How many people would leave the Soviet state if they were allowed to go free? You don't know? Ask Mr. Dyer.

""My guess is that if the doors were opened wide about one-seventh of Soviet citizens of all nationalities would think about emigrating,"" he writes.

Based on what?

But then, says G. Dyer, only Jews can go in large numbers because the Soviets have a ""face-saving excuse for why they want to leave."" Has Mr. Dyer never heard of Germans or Armenians leaving the ""workers paradise?""

And what should the free world do to help those Jews? Oh, nothing much: just keep playing as the Soviets expect us to play. He puts it this way:

""At the diplomatic level, every effort should be made to maintain that facade, since otherwise the emigration would be stopped.""

George Schultz and ""the people in official positions,"" are you listening? Even though it is just a facade, you better maintain it. Mr. Dyer knows his stuff. According to his conclusions ""most Soviet Jews really leave not for religious reasons, but because they are looking for a better Moscow.""

I have to disappoint Mr. Dyer. What the Soviet Jews really want is for people who have no knowledge or understanding of their problems whatsoever to unplug their word processors and devote their leisure time to some other activity.

Maybe fishing.

"One of the few things I actually agree with dissident Catholics on is the poor handling of the sex abuse crisis by the pope and bishops. 

JPII I think was too old and infirm to get a real handle on the crisis which happened towards the end of his papacy. Regardless he should not have given Law that cushy job in Rome.  Benedict XVI I think simply didn't get it. He did not understand that what people wanted was for him to hold bishops accountable--something he was not doing.

Pope Francis talks a good game---but he is short on substantive action. Changes to Canon Law are all well and good.  Meaningful and substantive action means removing bishops who cover up abuse or do not report it--and making sure people know why the bishop is being removed. Like Benedict, I am not sure Pope Francis gets this.  I guarantee you that if just one bishops was removed---that would take care of the problem.  The other bishops would be put on notice.",0,en,0

"Remember the days of decent $30 jeans? Yeah, neither do we. Ever since jeans expanded from its role as everyday casual gear to a high-fashion statement, the price of these rugged pants — along with the frequency of heavy washes and glaringly intentional tears — has gone up.

Of course, there’s expensive, and then there’s expensive. The latter was detailed in a Fox Business report about Scott Morrison, the founder of 3×1, a denim company that produces premium jeans. $1,200 premium jeans.

Of course, 3×1 puts out jeans by the tens, not the thousands, with a focus on customization rather than mass production. But there’s a host of other larger companies selling high-priced denim — and while they might not touch 3×1’s fourth digit, the sticker shock’s still enough to give most people the blues.

Here’s a quick look at who’s selling high-priced jeans in a store near you:

Abercrombie & Fitch: The popular retail brand is known for its ear-thumping in-store experience, and higher prices than rivals like American Eagle (NYSE:AEO). Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) does a number on jeans, selling the A&F Super Skinny Flagship Store Exclusive (also available in Destroyed Wash) for $120.

Levi Strauss: The gold standard for reasonably priced jeans? Sure. But Levi knows the money is where the money is. Enter the Made in US Skinny Jean, which Levi doesn’t sell directly, but it goes for $178 on amrag.com. Of course, Levi has put that number to shame on a pair of original 501s that sold for $60,000 in 2005 on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).

Guess?: Another name famous for their denim, Guess? (NYSE:GES) currently sports three jeans at that same $178 price — Lincoln Jeans (Establishment Wash and Rural Wash) and Rebel Jeans (Attic Wash).

Macy’s: Macy’s (NYSE:M) doorbuster deals are the stuff of legend, but when the retailer wants to go big, it goes big. Macy’s offers six different pairs of jeans for $198 from 7 For All Mankind and Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL).

True Religion: Finally! Not just beating but shattering the $200 mark is True Religion (NASDAQ:TRLG), which sells its Men’s Billy Premium Vintage jeans for $330.",0,en,0

"Minister responsible for Official Languages (Canada)

The Minister responsible for Official Languages is the Minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet who is entrusted with the enforcement of the Official Languages Act, ensuring that government services are available in both English and French, protecting minority language rights, particularly in the area of education, as well as promoting bilingualism throughout Canada. 

In 2003 the first Minister responsible for Official Languages was sworn in, on the creation of the ""Official Languages Branch of Intergovernmental Affairs"" within the Privy Council Office. In 2006, responsibility was shifted from the Privy Council Office to the Department of Canadian Heritage, and the branch was renamed the ""Official Languages Secretariat"".

Sections 42 and 43 of the Official Languages Act give the Minister of Canadian Heritage the specific responsibility of taking measures to advance the equality of status and use of English and French in Canadian society; under section 44 of that Act, the Minister must submit annual reports to Parliament on the matters relating to official languages for which the Minister is responsible.

In the meantime, if every illegal migrant was arrested and sent to a secure detention facility indefinitely (perhaps a northern military base), it would act as a deterrent compared to the current strategy, which is effectively an invitation for more to do the same.

"[Lung maturation therapy with glucocorticoids in threatened premature labor. Considerations of risk-benefit in evidence-based medicine].
Prematurity is a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Antenatal administration of glucocorticoids improves the neonatal outcome of preterm born infants. 1994 the NIH published recommendations for the use of glucocorticoids for women at risk of preterm delivery. A recent evaluation by the Cochrane Collaboration in 1999 showed that antenatal administration of glucocorticoids significantly reduced the rate of RDS and IVH in the gestational age between 24 and 34 weeks. Consequences of repeated courses of antenatal glucocorticoids are not sufficiently studied. The effectivity and safety regarding birth weights, infectious diseases, and the best timing remains unknown. Administration of glucocorticoids lowers fetal activity and heart rate variability. Effects on fetal growth, maternal and fetal immunosystem, and the development of atopic diseases are controversely discussed. Thus preterm labour not leading to a cervical ripening is not necessarily a reason for antenatal glucocorticoids. Antenatal glucocorticoids with PROM do not lower the rate of RDS but of IVH. No prospective randomized trial evaluated the effectivity of antenatal glucocorticoids in diabetes mellitus and IUGR. In preeclampsia beta-methason could improve the rate of RDS and the neonatal outcome. Still our knowledge of antenatal glucocorticoid administration is not sufficient. But despite possible (longtime-) risks for mother and child the administration of glucocorticoids according to the guidelines of the NIH is a major part in the treatment of prematurity and improves the outcome of premature infants. The indication for multiple courses of glucocorticoids should be considered carefully.",0,en,0

Assistant United States Attorney, Charlotte, North Carolina;
David A. Thorneloe, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY,
Asheville, North Carolina, for Appellee.


Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.
PER CURIAM:

       Kimberly Rachael Moore seeks to appeal the district court’s

order dismissing as untimely his 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (2012) motion.

The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge

issues      a      certificate         of         appealability.             28      U.S.C.

§ 2253(c)(1)(B) (2012).           A certificate of appealability will not

issue     absent      “a    substantial       showing      of        the   denial    of   a

constitutional right.”           28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2) (2012).                   When the

district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies

this    standard      by    demonstrating         that   reasonable        jurists    would

find that the district court’s assessment of the constitutional

claims is debatable or wrong.                 Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473,

484    (2000);     see     Miller-El   v.     Cockrell,        537    U.S.   322,    336-38

(2003).     When the district court denies relief on procedural

grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive

procedural ruling is debatable, and that the motion states a

debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right.                             Slack,

529 U.S. at 484-85.

       We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that

Moore has not made the requisite showing.                       Accordingly, we deny

a certificate of appealability, deny leave to proceed in forma

pauperis,       and   dismiss    the        appeal.       We    dispense      with     oral

argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately

"Brimfield: Police find big stash of marijuana during traffic stop

BRIMFIELD -- Police in Brimfield have recovered more than half a pound of marijuana after making an early morning traffic stop.

The officer pulled over a car after watching the driver leave an elementary school parking lot about 1:30 a.m. When the driver made a left turn from the right-hand lane, the officer pulled the driver over on Howe Road west of SR 43.

Police say the driver had a suspended license in addition to being found with the marijuana.

Brimfield's Chief David Oliver reported the traffic stop and arrest on the police department's Facebook page. He went on to add, ""Don't bring drugs near our schools.

"The Islamic State traces its most gory and sadistic practices straight to Allah and Muhammad.

[](/sites/default/files/uploads/2014/09/taliban-sword-11052007.jpg)To understand why the Islamic State not only decapitates its “infidel” captives, but also mutilates and mocks their corpses—and all to sadistic laughter—one need only turn to the Koran and deeds of Islamic prophet Muhammad.

The Koran exhorts believers to “Fight them [those who oppose Islam], Allah will torment them with your hands, humiliate them, empower you over them, and heal the hearts of the believers, removing the rage from their hearts” (Koran 9:14-15).

As usual, to understand the significance of any Koran verse, one must turn to the sira and _hadith_—the biography and anecdotes of Muhammad, respectively—for context.

Thus we come to the following account concerning the slaughter of ‘Amr bin Hisham, a pagan Arab chieftain originally known as “Abu Hakim” (Father of Wisdom) until Muhammad dubbed him “Abu Jahl” (Father of Stupidity) for his staunch opposition to Islam.

After ‘Amr was mortally wounded by a new convert to Islam during the Battle of Badr, Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud, a close companion of Muhammad, saw the “infidel” chieftain collapsed on the ground. So he went to him and started abusing him. Among other things, Abdullah grabbed and pulled ‘Amr’s beard and stood in triumph on the dying man’s chest.

According to Al-Bidaya wa Al-Nihaya (“The Beginning and the End”), Ibn Kathir’s authoritiative history of Islam, “After that, he [Abdullah] cut his [‘Amr’s] head off and bore it till he placed it between the hands of the Prophet. Thus did Allah heal the hearts of the believers with it.”

This, then, is the true significance of Koran 9:14-15: “Fight them, Allah will torment them with your hands [mortally wounding and eventually decapitating ‘Amr], humiliate them [pulling his beard], empower you over them [standing atop him], and heal the hearts of the believers, removing the rage from their hearts [at the sight of his decapitated head].”

The logic here is that, pious Muslims are so full of zeal for Allah’s cause that the only way their inflamed hearts can be at rest is to see those who oppose Allah and his prophet utterly crushed—humiliated, mutilated, decapitated. Then the hearts of the believers can be at ease and “healed.”

This is surely one of the reasons behind the Islamic State’s dissemination of gory videos and pictures of its victims: the new “caliphate” is trying to heal the hearts of every believer inflamed for the cause of Allah.

If this sounds too farfetched, consider the following picture of a decapitated “infidel” from the Islamic State’s websites. The Arabic caption to the left says “healing for hearts”—a clear reference to the aforementioned Koran verse:

Koran 96:15-16 also alludes to the fate of ‘Amr and offers more context applicable to the Islamic State: “No! If he does not desist, we will surely drag him by the forelock—a lying, sinning forelock.”

According to al-Alusi’s tafsir, or exegesis, after Abdullah placed his foot on the dying foe of Islam, ‘Amr opened his eyes and recognized him. The once proud chieftain lamented that he was being killed by a common “goat herder,” to which Abdullah replied, “Islam elevates and nothing is elevated above it.” He then sheared his head off. “But he could not carry it, so he made holes in the ears and put thread through them and dragged the head to the prophet. Then Gabriel, peace be upon him, came laughing and saying, “O prophet, you got an ear and an ear—and the head between for a bonus!”

Based, then, on the treatment of ‘Amr bin Hisham (AKA “Abu Jahl”) as recorded in Islam’s core texts—Koran, hadith, sira, and tafsirs—all sadistic acts being carried out by the Islamic State were in fact committed by the earliest Muslims and all to the complete approval of Muhammad (and apparently the “angel” Gabriel, too). They include:

•Beheadings and mutilations (e.g., holes in ears of ‘Amr)

•Humiliation and gestures of triumph (feet on chest of fallen victim, dragging his body, or head, on the ground)

•Laughter, mockery, and celebration (for the hearts of the believers are now “healed”)

Indeed, along with the “healing for hearts” image above, consider some other pictures taken from the Islamic State’s websites and how well they conform to the above accounts describing the slaughter of ‘Amr#:

Note how in the following four pictures, to demonstrate that the enemies of Islam have been brought low, as Koran 9:14-15 promised, Islamic State members make it a point to place their feet atop their fallen corpses, most of which were first decapitated. Note also how the ubiquitous black flag of Islam is always raised above the fallen “infidels”—a reminder that “Islam elevates and nothing is elevated above it,” as Abdullah told ‘Amr, with his foot on his chest, before beheading him.

Note the jocularity in the following picture—reminiscent of the “angel” Gabriel laughing and joking about the mutilated head of ‘Amr. (If Allah’s angel finds such human carnage amusing, shouldn’t Allah’s jihadi servants as well?)

The following picture is reminiscent of how ‘Amr’s head was treated: mutilated and dragged on the ground. In this case, it is a decapitated body that is being degraded:

The next two pictures are of especial interest because they actually use the relatively arcane Arabic word haz (bottom left-hand corner), which literally means “to make an incision,” to describe the beheading of Islam’s enemies. The standard Arabic word for “cut” generally used to describe a beheading is qata‘. That the word used (haz) is the same word found in the early jihad literature is no coincidence and indicative of the source of inspiration: Islam’s scriptures.

In short, not only are the members of the Islamic State closely patterning themselves after Muhammad—whom Koran 33:21 exhorts believers to emulate in all ways—but even in the most sadistic of details are they finding support in their prophet.

Nor should it come as any surprise that Muslims are aware of these accounts from early Islamic history. After all, the near hagiographic Battle of Badr, including the story of ‘Amr’s slaughter, is routinely glorified worldwide in mosque sermons, on Islamic satellite stations, and in Islamic texts. It is a source of great pride.

Thus when young Muslims express their anger and frustration at the state of affairs of the Islamic world, their clerics council them to go to the jihad in Iraq and Syria and decapitate themselves an infidel—which, according to the Koran, should “heal their hearts.”

(Perhaps that’s why one former British rock star and convert to Islam is so eager to decapitate Christians? Perhap that’s why a jihadi savagely pulled out and bit into the heart of a fallen Syrian soldier—to heal his own heart by sating his rage against Allah’s “enemies”?)

Such Muslims join the jihad, and not only do they decapitate, but they mutilate, humiliate, and laugh at the disgraced enemies of Allah—in perfect emulation of the Islamic glory/gory stories they grew up on.

This is the true cult of jihad which few non-Muslims can begin to comprehend—and little wonder, considering that their political leaders, professors, and media continue to babble foolishly about how Islam is the “religion of peace.”

"SIMI VALLEY, Calif., Nov. 25, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Global autism expert, therapist, speaker/performer, podcast host, author and mom Lynette Louise MS, BCN-T, has happily compiled a list of twelve surprising and actionable autism spectrum Christmas tips! As with all her autism suggestions, these tips are great for enjoying the holidays and offering concrete learnings for children on the autism spectrum as well as every other rug rat in your holiday household. They will be posted on her neurofeedback and autism website, http://www.brainbody.net, for Thanksgiving, November 24th 2011. She would love to share five with you now!

Every child likes to shop -- their way. So when you take your kids shopping, take them shopping -- not you. Do this for all your children, not just the autistic child. Admire their choices. So what if they buy their sister a jar of mustard? Maybe they think that is a good gift. Instead of simply redirecting them, try to understand why. In other words give control -- your children spend their days being ordered and shaped, so let go on the holidays and let them just be autistic (or fourteen) for a change. Make the car your friend. It is familiar and smells like family, so if they need a space to pull themselves together in, use the car -- it goes everywhere! Eat in unison. This means that if they have a special diet, either everyone picks their favorite foods and your ASD child feels happy with that, or everyone eats the special diet ... because way too often the difference in the diets drives the kids to tantrum. Give gifts that THEY want, NOT toys the educational department approves of. For example, if your child loves baby pillows, give him a refrigerator box full of them. If he wants that every year -- so be it. Those other toys come from our wishes not theirs. So those other toys are not gifts; they are lessons.

Christmas is a crazy mix of excitement and stress. Children feel that energy, especially more sensitive autistic ones. Lynette's tips will help moms, dads, grandparents and family friends approach the holidays with intention and fun. Stress often disappears when given the great gift of knowing what to do. Lynette reminds families, ""You can't teach a child to relax and enjoy family unless you do."" Happy Holidays!

"Jeff Zucker, the chief of the basement-rated CNN, was caught making a sex joke about Alisyn Camerota, who co-hosts his failed morning show New Day.

At some awards thing where the media celebrate one another, Zucker said of Camerota, “I was gonna say that I love waking up WITH YOU every morning, but I want to say that I love waking up TO YOU every morning.”

This is par for the course for Zucker, who has been credibly accused of looking the other way as his close friend and colleague at NBC, Matt Lauer, allegedly spent years preying on female staffers and subordinates.

In his various positions at NBC News, including as network president, there doesn’t appear to be any question Zucker knew what was going on with Lauer. According to the New York Post, Zucker found Lauer’s adventurous and adulterous sex life hilarious. Back in 2008, at another one of those awards ceremonies where the media celebrate each other, everyone at NBC, including Zucker, laughed uproariously as Lauer told the room that his colleague Ann Curry knows “how big my dick really is.”

Curry would later claim no one at NBC would listen to her complaints about a pervasive climate of sexual harassment. Presumably, this included Zucker, who is now making public sex jokes about the female co-host of his disastrous morning show, a woman in a vulnerable position in a news business that doesn’t have a lot of patience with middle-age females, especially those with the lowest-rated show in all of cable news.

Though no one can fault her, Camerota, who regularly lashes out at Trump as a sexist and accused her former Fox News boss, Roger Ailes, of harassment, cowered when she was asked about Zucker’s inappropriate joke.

Rather than call the man out who reduced her to a sex object in front of her colleagues, she did what so many vulnerable, aging women are forced to do when confronted with sexual harassment from someone with power over them: she made excuses for her harasser, saying, “That isn’t harassment, in my opinion, and I didn’t find it tone deaf, either.”

But what else is a woman on the darkside of 50, who has aged out of her chosen field, who cannot attract more than a few hundred thousand viewers, who has never once won her timeslot, supposed to do other than to allow the boss to figuratively pat her on the fanny once in a while?

Obviously, the hypocrisy at work here is as predictable as it is shameless.

If Tucker Carlson had told this same joke about a female Fox News colleague, the far-left CNN and the rest of the media would be on a 24/7 scalp hunt.

Can you imagine Mr. Decency himself, Jake Tapper, had Sean Hannity told this joke? Naturally, Tapper has not said anything critical about Zucker’s public objectification of Camerota. But Mr. Decency is in a much-weakened position himself. When you are barely attracting 600,000 viewers at the 4 p.m. hour, that can sap beta male’s moral courage pretty quick.

It’s been obvious for some time, especially with the serial lies, the encouragement of political violence, and the conspiracy theories CNN regularly traffics in, that things are toxic at the fake news outlet — that, as CNN’s continue to bottom out, a lot of people are violating their own conscience and sense of ethics to hold on to their jobs. Zucker’s brazen act of verbal leering, this revelation he’s a sex pest, goes a long way towards cementing that perception.

Haunted by wrong turns and roads not taken, we pursue images perceived as new but whose providence dates to the dim dramas of childhood, which are themselves but ripples of consequence echoing down the generations. The quotidian demands of life distract from this resonance of images and events, but some of us feel it always.""  - William Faulkner",0,en,0

"Re ""others, mainly the churches, failed in their duty to protect the children...""

This passing of the blame to churches fails to acknowledge the very strong role that government and wider society played.  The schools were chronically underfunded.  The federal government was responsible for inspection and oversight of the schools.  Government reports detailed the problems early on.  Yet they did not stop it.  And in many cases explicitly approved practices such as carrying out nutritional experiments on children in their care.   Contracting the operation of schools out to the churches did not absolve the government and Canadian society of their responsibility.",0,en,0

Evidence-based reviews of research literature are useful in determining the efficacy of specific clinical practices, but the review process is frequently time-consuming and costly. The purpose of this study was to identify important research questions in rehabilitation that are appropriate for evidence-based reviews. The focus of this study was rehabilitation after traumatic injuries. Topics were identified using the Delphi method, which utilized a panel of 24 researchers and clinicians with expertise in rehabilitation of traumatic injuries. The experts identified 71 topics, predominantly in the areas of spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury rehabilitation. The most commonly suggested intervention topics involved assessment of pharmacologic agents, the timing or intensity of interventions, or specific nonpharmacologic therapies and exercises. Topics were ranked by mean importance score. Ten of 24 questions in the top tertile were considered to have some or a substantial amount of available research and thus may be appropriate for structured evidence-based reviews. Similar methods could be used to identify appropriate topics in other areas of rehabilitation.",0,en,0

"It was a clear night, and the bright moon shone above in a perfect Cheshire Cat smile. Some 238,900 miles away from the moon floating in Earth’s orbit, a few dozen Camp Verde residents stood in Rezzonico Family Park, congregating around high-powered telescopes under the starlight on a dark Saturday night.

One of those telescopes pointed squarely at that four-day-old moon, letting onlookers get a closer glimpse of the surface of Earth’s satellite. The white disk often seen nightly transformed into a solid rock, pockmarked with craters and other features. Looking through the telescope, amateur astronomers could see how the crescent moon really was a shadow as the light faded on the white face of the moon, eclipsed by the Earth. Helpful guides pointed out that three of the craters on the surface made the unmistakeable shape of two ears on the side of Mickey Mouse’s iconic round head.

The Star Party held by the Astronomers of Verde Valley on Saturday, May 19, was the second held in Camp Verde this year, after a previous stargazing event held in February. For the astronomy club, this event comes at a moment of progress. In March, Camp Verde submitted an application to the International Dark Sky Association to become recognized as an official Dark Sky Community.

There are 18 certified International Dark Skies communities, four of which — Flagstaff, Fountain Hills, Sedona and the Village of Oak Creek — are in Arizona. With Yavapai and Coconino counties already implementing dark sky ordinances to cut down on light pollution, Astronomers of Verde Valley are embarking on a project to further the certification to towns and cities in the area, which could allow the whole Verde Valley to be certified as a dark sky area.

Along with Camp Verde’s application, the club’s president Bruce Morrow sees his hometown of Cottonwood as the next step for dark sky certification. Beyond the county’s ordinances, municipalities must implement their own additional local laws, allowing for enforcement of the rules.

The goals of these ordinances are not only to limit light, but to manage it, designing street lamps and other public lights that point down rather than out, preserving the darkness in the community.

Members of the group see the value of astronomy not only in recreation, but in economics and tourism.

“Arizona has more large commercial telescopes than anywhere in the world,” said the group’s former president JD Maddy, referring to the more than 80 in the state. Maddy had his high-powered telescope pointed at Venus, which he said was 83 percent illuminated, but would be rising higher in the sky over the course of the month. “That’s why it’s so important that Arizona wants to keep its skies dark. We’d lose hundreds of millions in business if astronomy went away.”

Some of that was on display Saturday night, with several attendees hailing from out of town as part of a WeekendZona trip to Camp Verde with Local First, a nonprofit that promotes local businesses throughout the state.

Laurie Berg Sapp came up from Phoenix for the weekend, along with more than 20 others on the trip, spending the weekend trying out the local restaurants and farmers market, kayaking and horseback riding, before being wowed by the display from the astronomers.

“I love it. The actual astronomers are so knowledgeable,” Berg Sapp said. “They’re showing you where to look, how to look, and what to look for.”

In addition to being a tourism destination, the star party gave residents of Camp Verde the opportunity to remind themselves of how special their own area can be.

“It’s beautiful here in Camp Verde. You can sit on your back porch and see the stars,” said local resident Julie Scott. “But gaining insight on the names of the stars makes it more intriguing to me.”

For the astronomers who brought their telescopes out to Rezzonico Family Park, showing off nebulae and stars up close, the opportunity to get the community involved only increases their own enjoyment.

“One of the elements of making the application is the community involvement,” Maddy said.

Persistent sexual arousal is defined as an intrusive and unwanted genital arousal unrelated to sexual desire and typically unrelieved by one or more orgasms. We report a patient presented with persistent sexual or genital arousal. A 62-year-old woman presented with a 5-month history of persistent genital arousal. The symptoms were unrelated to sexual stimuli but were relieved incompletely and temporarily by orgasm. Doppler ultrasound demonstrated multiple pelvic varices. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated varices in the pelvis, the vaginal wall, perineum, inguinal region, and anterior abdominal wall. Coil embolization of the dilated incompetent left ovarian vein was performed with marked reduction of symptoms. We proposed that the syndrome of persistent genital or sexual arousal in women warrants a careful and systematic examination for pelvic venous incompetence by Doppler ultrasound and MRI or computerized tomography, with appropriate tilt positioning and Valsalva maneuver, before assigning it to a central neurologic or psychologic etiology.",0,en,0

After spending nearly 8 months in jail, without the psychotherapy he needs, with no preparation, 3 days of medication, no support, no supervision, he was pushed out the door. This is the inevitable result.

Because there were no beds available at Western State hospital, recent state supreme court rulings in regards to the indefinite detainment of mentally ill persons, and to preserve authority over Mr Helman without discussing the case entirely, there was little choice but to release him until space became available for treatment.

Devotional: Humor

A joyful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. Proverbs 17:22 (NIV)

He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with shouting. Job 8:21 (NIV)

Is there anything better than a good laugh? One that makes your sides hurt and tears run down your eyes? For whatever reason, I've noticed, many of us forget to laugh with God. As my pastor once said (most conveniently after I had prayed and asked God if He had a sense of humor - I was in the 8th grade) ""If you don't think God has a sense of humor, look in the mirror.""

Jesus came to give us an abundant life and humor is very much a part of that. I know that with financial difficulties, bad health, bad drivers - especially, it can be hard to remember the humor of things. But I want to encourage you to laugh. For today's devotional, while unconventional (hey that's me!) I have listed some of the funniest movies I can think of.

Young Frankenstein - not suitable for young kids, but mostly innuendo that goes over their heads.

Princess Bride - inconceivable, I know!

‘Running and crying and screaming:’ Video captured vehicle following 6th-grader walking home from school

ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. –An emotional mother shared the details of a frightening moment involving her child. She said her middle school daughter was followed home from school on Thursday, May 9, and approached by a man in a car with a camera.

“It’s just shocking, because if I didn’t do (anything), if I didn’t run or anything, he probably would have gotten out of the car and probably grabbed me,” the young girl said.

The sixth-grade student, who did not wish to be identified, said she was walking home from Freedom Middle School Thursday afternoon when she noticed a man in a black car.

“He’s like, old looking, and he has a camera in his hand and he’s smiling at me and telling, with his finger, telling me to come here,” she said.

The girl said she immediately felt uncomfortable, so she started running.

“I run, and he’s still following me, and when he’s still following me, I’m about over there, and I’m running and crying and screaming, ‘Help me,’ so someone could come and stuff,” the child said.

Part of it was captured by surveillance cameras from the apartment complex the girl lives in. The video showed the child running to the gate, before a black car pulled in right behind her.

“I could sense my daughter was scared by the way she was running. I’ve never seen her run like that before,” the girl’s mother said.

The girl’s mother said she truly believes the man in the car wanted to take her daughter.

“It’s a parent’s worst nightmare to see something like that, and to know that there’s people out there watching children like that, to try to take them or do whatever they want to do with them,” she said.

The family said they filed a police report — and wanted to warn parents in the area.

“Talk to your kids. Let them know stuff like this can happen. You may not think it can or will, but it does happen,” the child’s mother said.

Officials with the Orange County Sheriff’s Office said they were investigating.",0,en,0

You know, I like The Miz, even as a babyface. And I'm down with him getting a better finisher than the SCF. But his figure four and Miz getting WOOOOs are appalling. It'd be one thing if Miz actually was great at the figure four and they asked Flair to give Miz his blessing and the rub, but it seems like it happened the exact opposite of that. Miz was given a finisher he's not about to turn down from a legend but fuck if he knows how to do it. What seems to be screwing him up too is that the figure four is applied with grabbing, twisting and bending the left leg but Miz instinctively seems to want to move as if he's grabbed the right leg. (Which I can't blame him for as it looks like an actual 4 with the right leg and not the other way around.)

So is there any chance Rock-Cena is NOT for the belt, or is that more or less a foregone conclusion? It hit me that perhaps the build to Wrestlemania might start with Cena interfering in the Rock-Punk match, costing Rock the title (as revenge for Cena-Miz two years ago, perhaps).

I think Rock/Cena II almost has to be for the belt. They need to raise the stakes somehow. Plus, having Rock going on mainstream TV with the belt as champ would be good visibility.

Yeah, I think it's very possible that Rock will lose, but then I think he'd still win at Elimination Chamber, if just so Punk can tour as champion while Rock only makes a few appearances between now and WrestleMania. Cena costing him the win would add great symmetry between the two.

I'm less enthused with the apparent top Mania matches than I can remember being in years. Rock/Cena for the title is balls. I understand why they want to do it, of course. When it makes money you do the rematch, clearly. It would be forgivable with more compelling programs underneath. But Punk/Taker does absolutely nothing for me, Justin's admirable frame for it notwithstanding. It's still just someone jobbing to Taker, and it won't top last year's bout with Trips, with the HITC and Shawn and end of an era and all the history coming to fruition. God only knows why Taker doesn't want to end on that, besides I guess for money. And then, to add to that, Lesnar/HHH? So they paid Brock seven figures to job to Cena and semi-retired Hunter? Of all people? What a fucking colossal waste of money. Ugh.

You can bitch and moan about how much you may hate the 'What' chant, but the live audience eats that shit up. Any arena on any given show will break out it a What chant. No matter how awesome Austin was, no matter what he accomplished as a wrestler, 'What' will be his legacy. It's here to stay and there's nothing anyone can do about it.

Isn't the WrestleMania card all fan speculation at this point, though? We don't even know the results of the Royal Rumble yet, to say nothing of Elimination Chamber.

Originally posted by CruelAngel777That Dr. Shelby chant from the crowd was the best. I loved the whole Anger Management graduation segment more than I thought possible.

I laughed out loud when he mentioned almost casually that Kane and Bryan are the first two to graduate from his classes.

I feel the Rock and Punk are knocking it out of the park.Rock's comedy stuff is an after thought and he's all serious when he addresses the Champ.The Shield's attack was solid, and of course the Rock sold it like he always does sold beat downs. Big time.

Miz's figure fout was terrible but the match was good.Cesaro and Orton had a good match as well, and the same for Sheamus vs Barrett. Sure, we've seen these matches before but I prefer getting these matches over random lame squashes.

The one thing I missed in this year's build up to the Rumble is the video with all the numbers.But I can forgive them as long as I get to point at the WM sign starting Sunday.

Originally posted by JustinShapiroFirst of all, Cena's sociology promo was one of his cringiest ever. That said,

Originally posted by lotjxIts a shame Cena winning the Rumble is all, but certain.

I kind of wish it was certain. Rock should win, Cena should win, lock it all in place in the biggest possible way, no shenanigans to try to keep things interesting for the February PPV and a Rumble winner challenging for the A-title for the first time in a while.

I've no issue with a rematch and a Cena win if they actually do something interesting with it, like, you know, turn him heel. But deep down we both know that won't happen, Cena will simply get his win back and all will be set right with the world.

(even though losing last year really didn't seem to bother him all that much)

Originally posted by John OrquiolaMiz was given a finisher he's not about to turn down from a legend but fuck if he knows how to do it.

At one point, I was half expecting him to somehow end up putting the figure four on his own legs.

On the most recent Lance Storm show on the Observer site, Storm (quoting Shane Helms) said that Miz's figure-four should be renamed the figure-forgot because he couldn't remember how to do it properly.

He also pointed out that it was a beat-the-clock match so when Ziggler's leg slipped, Miz probably just panicked, thinking he didn't have time to start the move over, but that's less clever.

This show was notable for having both Cena and Rock deliver two of the worst promos of their careers.

I hope Lesnar dashes Rocky's championship dreams... get them both out of the way and in a Mania match people will pay to see (which is the point).I'm just dreaming, but this way we avoid ""Cena vs Rock: Once in a Lifetime Again""

I rather see Punk lose the belt to Cena at Mania than see Cena vs Rock again.

You know, Vince never said The Rock would win if The Sheild got involved, just that Punk wouold vacate the title. Maybe this is a way to get to a Punk/Cena/Rock match at Wrestlemania. If they could figure out a way to make it a Heavyweight/WWE Championship unification match, even better! (...since they seem to be officially ending the brand split.)",1,en,1
