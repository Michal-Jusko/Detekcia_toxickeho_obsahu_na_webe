I must have watched a different Siemian than you did.  His long bomb to Sanders was right on the money and Sanders only dropped it AFTER taking two steps with the ball.  What ever happened to the player becoming a runner after two steps?  I think that should have been ruled a fumble and recovery by Sanders but the pass could not have been more accurate and was certainly well over ten yards.  And Trevor has consistently put the ball on the money for passes of twenty yards or longer last year and so far this year.  Our WRs were simply not getting open and were shut down by rookie CBs whom they should have beaten easily.  I saw WRs not getting open and thereby forcing Trevor to scramble to extend plays all to no end. Siemian's arm is just fine.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
"Douglas:  We share a common view on these issues.  Goodness knows, each of us has likely ""screwed up"" enough ourselves to fill our ""guilt"" bag.  We sure don't need to take on guilt from other persons and actions over which we had and have no control....i.e. guilt from the past.

However, if we aren't willing to confront actions taking place today which we feel are unjust, it's a different story.  If we sit passively and don't confront such actions we are, IMO, giving our tacit agreement to those actions.  

My focus is on TODAY and what I can do to help....It may just be very small actions, but if I fail to take them, then I feel the guilt of negligence and cowardice.  my regards, Gary",0.3,0.0,0.4,0.0,0.1,0.1,0.0,0

"You got it backwards Mark.  This move by Elway confirms how astute he is in understanding the locker room mentality.

The competition was for Lynch's benefit.  It justifies the Broncos backing Siemian, because the competition was public and fair and allowed Lynch the opportunity that Elway promised him when he was drafted. This gives Lynch a taste of action, and motivation to study his tail off this season.  We need two quarterbacks.  We will always need two quarterbacks.  Elway found them and will develop BOTH.

Elway doesnt care what the media writes about him.  He eats in his steak house and runs the most successful franchise in sports.  Paxton being a long term project is only important to the media.  Elway knows what hes doing. 

For the next four years, Lynch will be learning, and providing top notch back up while finding his ceiling.

My impression is that comments can be ""disappeared"" through various mechanisms, none of them to do with ""a glitch"".

1. The laypersons who do the initial reviews trash them as badly uncivil posts, when they are not, and it does not see the light of day on the baord.
2. The laypersons let it get posted, but it gets flagged by others as offensive (when it is not, it simply grates on their sociopolitical preferences), and in some silly fashion gets deleted when it ought not get deleted.
3. I suspect the columnists and journalists themselves have access, should they want it, to fast-track intervention with those in charge of board moderation.

I am not suggesting it is a Globe and Mail editor who is behind what is happening.

Today, nothing has improved. The full-scale assault on taxation, that it itself is some sort of evil, combined with the tarring of agencies that legally remove children and that can only provide marginal shelter, has made the problem worse.
The core problem is the lack of resources because of the silence of our elected officials.

Fr. Reese ends the article noting that this particular issue seems to fall through the cracks when various advocacy groups look past their agreements and focus on their disagreements.

If one is a conservative, liberal, libertarian, Catholic, Black, Muslim, Jew, millennial or boomer, that's all we need to know about that person.  We stop there, discussion over.  The end result, we ALL tend to be fed a steady diet of fear.  No wonder so many in the Western world fear Islam.  With all this fear OF Islam, that same fear stokes liberals who fear rights will be pulled back instead of expanded, fueling conservatives who fear that liberals are giving away or spending our future, fueling even more fear that begets more fear....

Trump has begun negotiations with China by playing rough. He will continue this line of action until he gets what he wants which I assume is a redress of trade with China. Currently the US runs an annual deficit of as much as $240 billion with China. To achieve his jobs creation policy Trump must significantly reduce it. Shifting that much trade activity will be a wrenching change for China since it runs a deficit with much of the rest of the world. It will obviously resist and must be pushed off its position.

However, Trump is smart enough to know that he cannot get his way on everything and must give on a few things to get what he wants. Taiwan will be bargaining chip.

""Priesthood and religious life were taken off their pedestals"" by Vatican II? Hardly. Vatican II spawned a previously unheard of emphasis on an ""in persona Christi"" priesthood, where the priest is elevated as a Jesus-representative, and acts ""in the person of Christ."" The basis for this ""in persona"" clericalism was the Vulgate translation of 2 Co 2:10 which has since been superseded by the Catholic NAB/NABRE Bible to read ""in the presence of Christ,"" not in the person of. A Vatican house of cards now without a foundation. We do not need 'divine' priests or 'infallible' popes.

It would be a sin to increase the discrimination and misogyny in the Church for the convenience of making more priests, while barring women and LGBT. Jesus said, ""Do this in memory of me,"" to all disciples present, both men AND women.

She and I had looped a pond by a school and were approaching the playground, where my kids & hubby were playing. Both dogs were ten feet in front of us.  A man at the playground stepped out and smacked one dog with a ski pole and began screaming at us about leash laws.  She recalled her dogs, who sat at her side while the man continued to brandish the pole and scream. My Popeye-esque husband hustled over and his presence caused the man to lower his voice and his pole. We promptly left.

"(cont.)  The US isn't.  This thread reflects the fact that very few Americans take the clear, imminent, and existential NK threat to the US seriously.

In sum, there is a high probability that the US will experience a catastrophic strategic defeat in a war with NK.

Trump, Mattis, Durban, McMaster, Kelly, Tillerson, and Haley have all made clear that the only acceptable option for the US is:

""Complete, verifiable, and irreversible NK denuclearization.""

The chances of that happening before NK reaches the red line of deployable thermonuclear ICBM is nil.

That leaves the military option which will probably destroy SK, Japan, NK, and the US.  Any tactical victory the US will achieve over NK will be pyrrhic.

The only way forward for the US is to avoid war in Korea, but it is highly unlikely that Trump will accept a NK with thermonuclear ICBMs;  thus, there is going to be a catastrophe for 100s of millions.

When someone buys a BMW, Subaru, Hyundai/KIA, Mercedes, Volvo, Mazda, Nissan, Audi/Porsche, VW, Jaguar, Land Rover, you are sending most of the purchase price of the vehicle out of Canada, never to benefit yourself or your children or your fellow Canadians.

"Good question, Little Dickie.  There were two main reasons: 
1. Some German leaders were concerned about a possible Allied counter-attack;  the British and French still offered resistance in neighbouring areas. 

2. There was much Nazi high command disagreement.  Some commanders wanted the attack, some did not.  Hitler felt HE had to prevail...and he prevaricated. 

3. The Germans did renew the attack--but the delay cost them dearly.  By the time their forces mobilized, most of the men had been taken off the beach. 

No question that this delay saved a British army.  However, it came at a significant cost: scores of men lost in combat and during the evacuation, abandoning 272 ships, 177 aircraft and 2,400 guns.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

"Many readers remember the argument that the tax revenue from Measure 97 would actually come, not from the corporations, but from Oregon consumers when the cost of the tax was added to the price of goods.  That was a sound argument......profits may not ""trickle down"", but, I guarantee you, increased costs do.

A 20% tariff on goods from Mexico doesn't mean the Mexican government will be ""paying for building THE WALL""....not hardly.  It means the cost of goods coming from Mexico will increase by 20% at the point of import....usually at a wholesale level.  That increased cost will be ""passed along"" and eventually reach the ""end user"".....the American consumer of the imported goods.  It may have the net effect of a ""protective tariff"" by making American products or crops more competitive on the market, but it does not constitute ""Mexico paying for the wall.""

"GIGO? Is the data the FBi uses to profile communities provided by the city PDa themselves and thus perhaps prejudicial towards a self-serving agenda? Yes, I’m skeptical about anything the government does anymore, particularly policing. “Report” enough crime to support increases in cops but not so much that would alienate business investment or drive down property values. The backlash to creating a mythology of growing crime is more cops and excessive and heavy handed policing in response to ""the numbers"". Instead, police need to focus on the craft of local problem-oriented policing based on the idea that crime and disorder problems are ongoing and have their roots in local social dynamics; identify the larger social issues and work with other resources and agencies to try to address them. The “stats” based over simplistic one-size-fits-all approach just moves us closer to becoming a police state.

Not one case of a white sexual assault on a black female was found in the FBI study.”

I don't know if I completely buy that argument, and if Rosen truly believes in the free market, then what employers offer their employees shouldn't affect him.

"Yes, there have been many times in history when media sources have been misleading (Bronson probably will remind us soon about The Washington Post and the Iraq war), and, as terrible as those cases have been, I don't think we can disregard the many, many more times that journalists have led us toward light and truth (Spotlight is a good recent example, http://spotlightthefilm.com/). Most of the time – such as with the Iraq war – I think, journalists have been misled by ""official sources,"" (and trying too hard to get a scoop over getting it right) then are left holding the bag for the propaganda, when others are the originators of the lies and misinformation. That said, journalists still are responsible for what they publish. It's not enough to just report what someone anonymous said. ... And there does seem to be way more punditry in today's media (cable news, especially), which gives the impression that everyone has an opinion, when that's really not the important part (truth is!).",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

"Very well said justducky.  I can remember back in the late '70's' early 80's shopping for a rental while attending UofO.  One that I viewed had a huge hole in the closet wall that overlooked the parking lot.  I saw my car, lol.  I asked the woman showing it and she LOL and said ""NO, if you don't want it there are 10 folks behind you who will""  I was stunned.  I asked her if she felt awful about showing an apt in such poor condition and she proudly stated ""No, not at all""

"US Code cannot compel anyone to stand during the anthem. Doing so is a clear violation of the 1st Amendment. Standard and tradition does not = ""right thing to do."" In fact, standard and tradition have often been the driving force behind many of the wrong things we've done throughout our history. 

Standard and tradition where the excuses behind slavery, Jim Crow, women's lack of franchise, and LGBTQ rights to exist. Standard and tradition are the reason that women and minorities continue to face discrimination as wells as wage, opportunity, and justice disparities.

"It is heartbreaking to see Venezuelans fleeing in all directions depending on what is close to them - Brazil, Colombia, Curacao, Cuba, Haiti, Trinidad, Peru and those with means, of course, the US and even Canada. Yet, most prefer Colombia because of the language and because they need no visa to enter the country. This article truly expresses many of the frustrations I've seen there while working and helping people. But violence and government repression have escalated so much this year that even NGOs, Human rights activists, diplomats, and almost all foreigners I encountered there are now leaving the country. Just getting a flight ticket there is a real nightmare. 

P.S. The journalists that are covering day-to-day events across Venezuela are some of the bravest people out there. It is not just reporting; it's even finding something to eat and a safe place to stay for a few hours before the next violence comes out. Great for the Globe and Mail to cover these stories.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
