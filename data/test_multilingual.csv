"Dear Mr. Prime Minister.  Can you please explain, in the interest of fairness, why the liberal government decided to drop the tax on stock options, which would apparently have raised more than this increase in personal corporation tax.  Can you also explain why civil servants can painlessly income split, but corporation owners will now be forced into a grey zone where paying spouses for legitimate work done on behalf of the family business will have to be justified umpteen times over?

"Work has been terribly busy for me lately. However this does not change my view about myself that I seem to be born a workaholic - I just seem to enjoy busying myself with work. At least this keeps negative thoughts (which I am prone to) at bay.

I really do enjoy this current assignment I am doing as from this I get to know some really good friends. Just like I always say - Friends may be all around me but those that I could really have fun with with minimal care about my ""image"" are few. And for these people I really do treasure them. With them, it also helps to brighten up my day despite the tedious & mind-boggling work that I've to perform. Time flies~! =)

but sometimes it flies too fast that I find that I haven't done much at the end of the day.. =S

What makes my life easier is that the client has been rather cooperative & tries their best to furnish me with whatever document I request for or answer any queries that I may have. I am indeed impressed by their understanding for the nature of our work is to probe.. =)

But all this seems to change once I told the client that me & my colleague are new to the job. They seem to treat us not with so much respect anymore. And that's when the whole trouble starts - greehorn like us will get scolded by those damn lowly accounts staff for things that are not our fault or for ""disturbing"" their work. What the hell~! Do these people know what they are talking about?

Well, guess there isn't much I could do except to bear with it till I've got more experience to sense that I'm being scolded for the wrong thing & for that I could fight for the whatever ""human right"" that I should be entitled to while at work.. =S

Apart from this, I've been working late for almost 2 weeks straight ever since I started in this assignment. Pathetic it may seems but I feel like as if the later I work the more energetic I become. Probably its becos' I've got my colleagues there to joke around as I work? =p

But hey, am still human~! Its not as if I won't feel tired. Everytime it comes to 11pm I would start feeling feverish & all. In fact, all these late nights has taken a toll on my body & nw I am sick. Serious sore throat...haiz.. =(

Luckily all these late nights don't come without an itsy-bitsy bit of ""incentive"". At least I get to take cab home at the client's expense. Haha, after I started on this work I've taken more taxi than I've ever taken in my whole life. Cool~! =P

Luckily this is not at my own expense if not I would have been broke by now. Solely my taxi claim for this month chalks up to a freaking 200 bucks ar~! =S

What I never thought possible for me,You've done & that I'll always treasure,My heart burns fervent with love for thee,Our souls delight in each beyond all measure.

And as you now place your sweet lips on mine,I know for certain I'm enraptured with an angel divine.

Its a cooling Sunday morning & here I am blogging & reading up on the case I am suppose to start with next week instead of being out with darling. This is so as darling will be in camp till the next week & will not be able to book out. I do miss him but at least the work that I've to prepare for kept me busy & helped to keep my thoughts for him (during the day) at bay.

But now as I blog & listen to various songs on my laptop I can't help but think out loud: I MISS YOU, DARLING~!=)

For the past week have been busy with training. Thou I am trained in this field of work, but this orientation training by my comapny helps me clear other queries I had about the job as well as expose me to other unusual situations I might face on the job.

Some topics covered are documentation & different sections which I have to do when on the job. One the issues that interest me alot is that about professional skeptism.

This is particularly important for my work. One of the fundamental of this is that I've to be skeptical & questioning about documents given to me by my client. One big mistake for me to commit is to accept every single explanation given by the client to me without even thinking whether it is reasonable or not.

With my formal work starting this coming week, I hope that I will be able to apply what I've learnt in school & from the training session for this past week. Hoping that all will turn out good for me.

Am slowly moving towards my goal in life...

Slowly but surely...

Now, its back to reading up on the job I'm given for next week....

Since today i'm at home, i'll write about the unpleasant events that happen right before my eyes as a Singaporean. Well it's not that Singapore is all that bad but there are people out there that make the whole Singapore seem so bad!

Well yesterday while walking on the way home from the MRT station I saw a old woman got knocked down by a Lexus SUV. The old woman's leg got crushed under the right wheel of the SUV and she was in such pain that she was shouting so loudly. Of course after seeing the old woman got knocked down I ran over to the scene and as expected I saw an open fracture with her lower leg twisted and crushed in a L shape. The driver reversed his right wheel off her leg and I saw the real devastation, the leg was crushed and protruding out.

Here's a rough picture of how the fracture look like:

While there was another bypasser lady that consoled the old woman, I ran across the street to the nearest NPP to call the police officers out. By the time I returned with 2 police officers there were a dozen people surrounding the scene, grrr! These kaypoh ppl ought to get hit themselves too!

While waiting for the paramedics the police officers tried to get some contact information from the old woman but she was in too much pain and too disorientated. While talking to her and taking her vital signs, she told me that she was 93 years old. I too thought that she was very strong at her age! To check for any signs of spinal injury I asked her whether she's feeling and numbness or pain anywhere else. Luckily none of this sort cos she's still moving her upper body abit.

Well others kept on looking and gossiping I attended to the old woman while the other bypasser helping left. There was so much people crowding around the scene of accident till the police officer had to chase them away and disperse the crowd. But some still stayed on but did nothing to help but just rather, gossip.

Well luckily the paramedics came quickly enough just about after 10 minutes and they took over by bandaging and placing a support on her broken leg. They then placed her on the stretcher and sent her to SGH for treatment.

This male driver in his forties admitted that he only looked at the oncoming traffic on his left when turning out of the car park and not in both directions before turning out of the car park. According to his claim, he saw the old woman and slammed his brakes but the car took some time to stop so it crushed her leg.

Well more or less it shows the attitude of some drivers in Singapore. And one thing I found out since i came back from US is that Singaporeans never follow stop signs! That is why the need for so much traffic lights everywhere!

Well another point I'd like to mention is the Smile Singapore campaign. It will never work if you ask Singaporeans to smile and yet have so much bad habits like not giving up their seats on the trains and buses(pretending to read the newspapers or something else), crowding in front of the train door, refusing to let alighting passengers go when there is a courtesy sign in front of these boarding passengers IN FOUR NATIONAL LANGUAGES to allow alighting passengers to go alight before boarding. There are many other things that need to be changed...

I'm not saying Singaporeans and/or Singapore is all that bad but the behaviors of some Singaporeans are left much to be desired. Especially when they're teaching their kids the same thing too!

While some people would say and think to themselves, what other people do has nothing to do with me, I disagree on that. This is becos' if they are displaying such undesirable behaviors in public that portray such a bad image of our country. They can do it at home for all I care, as long as they don't come out of it and make Singapore look like such a rude country!

Below is a letter I wrote to Get Real show in Channel News Asia early this year: The highlighted part is the part that got featured.

Dear Diana,

Talking about manners and considerate manners for fellow manners, Singapore still have a long long way to go. Well compared to our fellow neighboring countries, we certainly have a more courteous society.

But personally I feel that these manners start from the education system in particular. A contradicting education system which confuses our young Singaporeans. Very often back in the days of our schools, even up to tertiary education, we are told to clear our plates and receptacles after eating, but yet when these very children go out to town with their parents, they are told not to clear their plates, and instilled with the very opposite thinking that someone is paid to remove their plates and receptacles after eating.

So what are our Civics and Moral Education subject in schools for?

Some people would say that by not clearing our plates, we are instead creating jobs for the people in the housekeeping industry, keeping senior citizens employed, but how would they feel if it is their own family members clearing the plates for them?With the same point, you would never see a Singaporean leave their plates for someone else to clear at home. Why? Because it is THEIR homes and they feel the responsibility to keep it clean!

On a second point, maybe Get Real! should travel to some crowded MRT stations, like Raffles Place or City hall to see how Singaporeans behave, and at the same time filming in the same inconsiderate people who squeeze on the train when others are alighting, oblivious to the notice in the FOUR national languages and announcements asking them to give way to alighting passengers. To a funny note, I'd like to play rugby with these people sometimes in order to get off the train.

And also for those people who stand at the glass panels by the train doors, I would often think of them like the Chinese Lions who stand guard at the door of a place. SMRT and SBS transit for a start should start taking away all those glass panels on their trains, and solve this problem of these people without a spine.

You cannot run away from rude fellow Singaporeans. They are existent in every corner of the island.Even when at home, some Singaporeans come home to a partying neighbor party late into the wee hours of the morning. And the interesting thing is that even the police cannot do much, as mentioned before they cannot do much about these residents except to advise and warn them. Very seldom we see the Miscellaneous Act (Cap 184, 14&15) being enforced.

Interestingly, Miscellaneous Act (Cap 184, 11f), even enforces on spitting:Nuisances11. ‚Äî(1) Any person who commits any of the following offences shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000:(f) spits in any coffee shop, market, eating house, school house, theatre or public building, or in any omnibus, railway carriage or other public conveyance, or on any wharf or jetty, or in any public road, or on any five-foot way or sidewalk of any public road, or in any other place to which the public has or may have access.

We all know Singapore is the only country around having a Courtesy campaign annually, begging Singaporeans to be more considerate, but do we all listen to it?

Maybe we can start by enforcing these these even outside of the schools.

Went Kayaking with darling, sis & 2 other friends we knew from the one-star kayaking course. It was a totally fun day except for the little shouting match that me & darling had during midday... -_-""

I really hate it when I perceive a guy to be so chauvanistic always wanting his way. Then well, when this happens the egoistic me will usually not give way & PURPOSELY do the opposite.

Just like in this case, we had alittle difference in the place we wanted to kayak to. Darling thinks that I am not good enough to go further out but I think that I was quite fine. So this leads to the little war between us.. -_-""

But after having my way I sorta regreted abit coz the wave there is indeed rather strong & scary. Haiz, blame on my stubborness? -_-""

But I must say that this is still a great practice for me as after 2 rounds of kayaking in that area I find it more shiok than scary. Hmm..that is at least so before I start to capsize..Wahaha~! =P

"The present invention relates generally to a method and an apparatus for welding a spherical metal to a matrix metal using electrical-resistance welding. More particularly, it relates to a method and an apparatus for welding a ball member to an end of a matrix cylindrical body to make a plunger which is adapted for use in a directional control valve for controlling fluid communication in the valve.
For aiding in understanding of the present invention and an application thereof, reference is made firstly to FIG. 1 which shows a typical solenoid-operated directional control valve 51 which has formed therein a first fluid passage 56, a second fluid passage 57 and a third fluid passage 59 and also contains therein a displaceable cylindrical plunger 52 of prior art having joined to its opposite ends a pair of spherical balls 55, 60. In normal position of the valve 51 when its solenoid 53 is in deenergized, or off, state, the plunger 52 is urged by the tension of a coil spring 54 to be positioned such that the ball 55 on the right end of the plunger closes the port of the first fluid passage 56 and the other ball 60 on the left end of the plunger keeps open the port of the second fluid passage 57, so that the third fluid passage 59 is in communication with the second passage through a plunger chamber 58 in which the plunger 52 is displaceably mounted, as shown in FIG. 1. When the solenoid 53 is energized, on the other hand, the plunger 52 is shifted leftward by the electromagnetic force created by the then energized solenoid while overcoming the spring tension until its ball 60 on the left end closes the port of the second fluid passage 57 to shut off its communication with the plunger chamber 58, and the first fluid passage 56 is opened to the plunger chamber 58 so that a fluid communication is then made between the first and third passages 56, 59.
Referring specifically to the plunger 52 of the prior art, it has formed at each end thereof an inward recess 61 having respective spherical surfaces conforming to those of the balls 55, 60 for receiving therein part of the ball. As indicated by solid lines in FIG. 2, the recess 61 is formed with its center located on the axial center line L1 of the plunger 52, which center line L1 is in turn in alignment with the axial center lines L2, L3 of the first and second fluid passages 56, 57 in the valve, respectively, as shown in FIG. 1, so that the balls 55, 60 joined to the cylindrical plunger body close sealingly the ports of the fluid passages 56, 57.
According to a conventional method to fix the balls, each ball is placed in its corresponding recess 61 and joined to the plunger body 52 by laser welding the adjoining area between the ball and the radially outer circular edge of the recess. The welding is started from any convenient location, e.g. a point as indicated by arrow A in FIG. 2, and performed along and throughout a circular line of the above adjoining area.
In the laser welding which is carried out in a continuous manner along the circular line and causes the metal to be fused or melted by application of welding heat, however, a portion welded earlier naturally solidifies earlier than the other portions which are welded later. In welding the balls to the plunger body, the difference in solidification time produces a tensile stress in the weld which may cause the ball to be displaced radially as indicated by a phantom circle in FIG. 2. Such displacement of the ball causes its center line to be offset from the center lines L1-L3 of the plunger body and hence from the first and second fluid passages 56, 57, with the result that the ball fails to seal tightly its corresponding fluid passage port.
Furthermore, application of the welding heat by the laser welding for fusion of the metal may cause deformation of the balls 55, 60 from their sphericalness, thereby affecting the sealing performance of the plunger in the directional control valve and hence the operation of the valve.
For achieving satisfactory fluid-tight sealing of the fluid passage ports in the valve, it is important that the plunger body 52 have as little error as possible in its axial dimension and also that the balls 55, 60 should be as true as possible in their sphericalness. For the latter purpose, steel balls similar to those employed in a ball bearing may be advantageously used for their high precision in sphericalness. However, these balls are usually made of a high carbon steel and, therefore, offer a disadvantage in that such ball when laser-welded and then cooled is susceptible to harmful cracks.",0,en,0

The notion that these 'Nations', while dependent on Canadian taxpayers for the greater part of their revenue, have the right to veto economic activity that provides such revenue is definitely impacting the public mood. There is also a growing skepticism arising from the manner in which public funds are being employed by aboriginal leaders and the degree to which it is being used to fund those programs for which it is intended - namely, the improvement of aboriginal society.

As polling starts to reflect the constancy of this trend, as apparently is now the case, the result will in time be inevitable.

When I've been in Britain in recent years I've noticed that newspapers cover events in Australia, to which Britons remain emotionally linked, but not in Canada. Any attachment that remains on our part is purely nostalgic and unreciprocated. Time to move on...

First they can withhold sentence and put the person on probation with a condition of probation that he gets treatment for any drug issues.  Secondly, the Judge can sentence the person to prison (assuming the underlying crime is a felony) and order drug treatment.  However that 'order' is more by way of a suggestion than a real order.  The big problem is the need far exceeds the available treatment program space.  As a result, many inmates are released before they can be enrolled in any program.  If you think it would be a good idea for courts to ignore punishing for the underlying crime simply because a perp has a drug problem, well, good luck with that.

Biography

Offenbach's father, Isaac Juda Eberst, born 26 October 1779 in Offenbach am Main, took the name Offenbach in 1808 when he was already in Deutz where he had moved in 1802.Yon, Jean-Claude. Jacques Offenbach. Editions Gallimard, Paris, 2000.

The alternative would appear to be a long explanation of the Napoleonic edict.

  
Thank you, that sounds good, although I would prefer a link to an explanatory article or some footnote, but maybe that's just me. One more thing: the italics around his father's name and the bolding of Offenbach ought to be dropped.    

 Play titles 
Confusingly, in 'other stage works', three of the play titles with a Wikipedia link are no longer spelled the same (case) as given in the articles about the plays...   
Can you clarify? There are no red links in that section. zach 
There aren't any red links because the three plays in question are piped links to their English titles. Cg2p0B0u8m's observation that the French titles in these articles uses different capitalisation is correct. We know that the most widely used style of French title capitalisation, which is a bit idosyncratic and not cosnsistently applied in French writing, is not used in the opera or classical music projects on Wikipedia where a strict but easily understood system is used. Other projects are not so strict; that's why those articles on the plays use a different spelling.    
Ah. Missed that. Shouldn't we be using the English titles? After all The Tales of Hoffmann appears just below. zach 
Wouldn't that make for an awkward list as we don't have English titles for all these plays?    
Perhaps, but then what is the least bad solution? My primary editing instinct tells me that consistency should come first ‚Äî at least within the article. zach 
But at the cost of consistency within the paragraph. ‚Äî (shrug) Whatever, no biggie. The list itself is a useful improvement to the article, in whichever language the titles are listed.    

Yes, it's not a major thing. From Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(France_%26_French-related)#Works_of_art it seemed that only classical music and opera had opted out of l‚ÄôAcad√©mie fran√ßaise / into 'Grove'; no problem.

"Of course not, because that cultural appropriation happened centuries ago, during the Roman Imperial era when social justice and its warriors were nowhere to be found. 

The very same fetishization of German culture, clothing, food, gods, etc. happened back then in Rome, too, and oddly enough, major aspects of the culture of the Germanic tribes managed to still exist and thrive into the modern era. 

Much of it was adopted by Rome as a means of bringing the Germanics into the fold. English? Common law legal tradition? Days of the week like Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday? Holiday concepts like the yule log? All over modern society you've got examples of the influence of Germanic tribesmen and their ways, even though Rome utterly dominated their existence.

"You have to go home happy.""

Hey, it's great to enjoy your job. I enjoy mine immensely. But for sure there were a lot of jobs and a lot of days along the way to where I am now that didn't include ""going home happy"". Sometimes achieving something worthwhile requires sacrifice, y'know?

It's asinine platitudes like this that ensure most Canadians will remain throughly mired in mediocrity, straining to live their dream lifestyle on their declining wages supplemented by massive debt. Complaining all the while about it and demanding the government ""fix"" it. (The ""fix"", usually involving taking wealth from people who actually made sacrifices to achieve it.) Meanwhile billions around the world work 100x as hard for a fraction of the money and will - and are - rapidly overtaking complacent, airy-fairy places like Canada.

"The application of heat to the skin as a means to penetrate deeper into tissues has historically been used for pain relief of muscles and joints, as well as for the treatment of certain inflammatory conditions. The application of cold materials to the skin has also been used for similar treatments, especially for treating inflammatory responses such as joint inflammation.
Traditional heating devices have, in some instances, generated heat using chemical formulations, such as iron powder formulations, that oxidize when exposed to air. Commercially available thermal chemical formulation products are usually confined to disposable heat patches, which are available as loosely formed fabric bags filled with the exothermic composition. An alternate means of providing heat is by way of electrical heating elements that are attached to a power source. Since the desired time of use is often longer than 4 hours, in the case of an electrical source, the power source typically used in these types of devices is either an electrical wall outlet or a battery.
Other chemical heating devices include those products that incorporate heating portions into fabrics that can conform or are shaped to fit various parts of the body, such as the knee or the back as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,074,413. In these cases, typically the entire product, including the garment and the heat providing exothermic formulation materials, are disposable because they are incorporated into a unitary product. The chemical heating portion is not removable from such a unitary product, and therefore, the entire device is designed to be disposed following use. Each use can typically last for 6 to 12 hours, and a user may use 2-3 of these products over a 24-hour period. These types of products have the disadvantage of contributing to excess waste of material and higher cost since each use involves the use of an entire product form. In addition, these devices often have a layer of fabric, which is non-conductive, in-between the heat portion and the skin.
Other types of devices, such as those shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,366, exemplify elements that are not disposable, such as using a back belt with gel pack containers. In such a device the gel-packs must be manually re-heated or cooled, taking more active participation by the user in order to be reusable. Similarly, the device shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,416,534 uses a back belt with a flexible fabric, and a gel pack that is reheated using electrical heat. This type of device also involves active participation on the part of the user and a potential lag time in order to heat the gel-pack. U.S. Pat. No. 6,074,413 is directed to a disposable thermal back wrap having one or more thermal packs comprising a plurality of heat cells, wherein heat is applied to specific areas of the user's back, for pain relief. U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,144 is directed to a heating garment with pouch for accommodating inserted chemical heating packets that are air activated.
U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,366 is directed to an aerobic/cross training exercise belt. The belt comprises a straight piece of material having a fastener on each end whereby the ends can be fastened together to form a closed belt. A back lumbar support is connected to the rear body of the belt. The back lumbar support has at least one pocket to mount chemical gel-packs whereby the user would have a thermal application to the lumbar area while wear wearing the belt. The gel packs can be heated or cooled to the desired temperature. U.S. Pat. No. 6,623,419 is directed to a therapeutic back belt and related method of manufacture. The belt includes magnets that are secured to the belt and thermally active gel material. U.S. Pat. No. 5,179,942 is directed to a lumbar support therapeutic heat/cooling/air belt. The support has one pocket in the lower back section that is capable of receiving a packet to create a thermal change or provide air for support purposes.
Additional devices have also been disclosed, as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7,147,610, that incorporate massaging elements with the heating elements so that they are conveniently available in a single device. Such a device involves excess bulk, is non-discreet and requires the use of external power sources (i.e. a junction box) since the heating and massaging element require the use of electrical power. In addition, although the parts are reusable, electrical elements tend to be non-washable. Published U.S. Patent Application 2004/0082886 is directed to a therapeutic device for relieving pain and stress in the hands and feet. The portable device provides heat and vibratory therapies for the hand or foot.
U.S. Pat. No. 6,146,342 is directed to massage pad having a plurality of randomly actuated pressure inducing elements. The apparatus massages the body by subjecting the body to impacts from reciprocating plungers. The plungers are secured in a flat array within a flexible pad. Each plunger has an associated solenoid device that alternately causes the plunger to project from the pad and to retract within the pad. An electrical circuit includes a power cord and plug assembly, manual controls disposed serially on the cord and plug assembly, and a controller generating operating signals randomly to the solenoids. A heating element is optionally included in the flexible pad, with a suitable controller provided among the controls.
Still other types of devices, as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7,077,858, include those that use flexible heat exchangers to distribute cooling and heating agents to the skin utilizing electrical heat. U.S. Pat. No. 6,409,748 is directed to a heating pad with removable gel pack that provides rapid initial warming. U.S. Pat. No. 4,846,176 is directed to a thermal bandage having a conformable region that can be placed against the skin to uniformly heat or cool the contacted skin area.",0,en,0

"One would think that, if the Church asserts that abortion is such an overwhelmingly great evil, then it would approve of the use of contraception and education to reduce the instances of the overwhelmingly great evil (for, even in the eyes of the most conservative members of the Church, contraception cannot be compared to abortion).

"Ms. Woolley's balanced comments are perhaps the best I've seen on this issue. The most glaring shortcoming of a Canadian Judicial Council review is that it can only recommend removal of a judge. There are no other remedial recommendations it can make, regardless of the misconduct's seriousness. Close on the heels of that structural failure is a procedural one: there's no transparency in the process and clarity on how the decision to remove shall be made.

That status quo is counterproductive to the administration of justice. With the only available recourse being to fire the judge, the system is reluctant to take steps in cases where the a judge needs some kind of remedial attention short of being removed. It's shockingly poor human resource management.",0,en,0

"Otey Clark

William Otis ""Otey"" Clark (May 22, 1915 ‚Äì October 20, 2010) was a Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the Boston Red Sox in 1945. He was born in Boscobel, Wisconsin. The 29-year-old rookie stood 6-foot 1-1/2-inches and weighed 190 pounds.

Clark is one of many ballplayers who only appeared in the major leagues during World War II.  He made his major league debut on April 17, 1945, (Opening Day), pitching in relief against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium.  His finest pitching effort that season came on September 19 in the second game of a doubleheader at Fenway Park.  He hurled a complete game shutout against the Philadelphia Athletics, winning by a score of 3-0.

Clark also defeated Bob Feller in the 1945 season, in Feller's first game back in baseball following World War II.

Season and career totals include a record of 4-4 in 12 games pitched, nine games started, four complete games, one shutout, three games finished and an ERA of 3.07 in 82 innings pitched.  He struck out 20 and walked 19.  Also good with the bat and glove, Clark hit .208 (5-for-24) and handled 11 chances in the field without an error.

One day before appearing in the 1945 season opener, Clark pitched to Jackie Robinson in the latter's tryout for the Boston Red Sox.

At the time of his death in Boscobel, Wisconsin, on October 20, 2010, he was considered one of the oldest living former MLB players.

"Part 3
The practice of reserving the Eucharist is ancient, but the place of reservation was a cupboard in the sacristy, and the purpose of the reservation was to have the Eucharist available to take to the sick and dying. It absolutely did non occur to anyone in those early days to expose the Eucharist for adoration. It was meant to be eaten and drunk.

In the fifty years before V2, the ancient practice of regular communion was revived. People were slow to adopt this revised Eucharistic theology. The V2 liturgical revisions had many objectives, but one of these was to accelerate this return to the understanding of the Eucharist PRIMARILY as sacred food; and as part of that process, the altar became once again a table, a direct symbolic replacement for the dinner table at the Last Supper, and with it the tabernacle got displaced in various ways in different churches.

Extbase will get the relation between the two objects for you.

It‚Äôs Time for Conservative Radio to Leave Clear Channel

Speech can never by free if unscrupulous men and women are allowed to control it. When I was coming up there was a saying, ‚ÄúI can say what I want it‚Äôs a free country.‚Äù You probably have to be over forty to remember that sentiment. That type of thinking was prominent when the country leaned more Conservative. Then the Avant-garde, the Lenny Bruces, the Richard Pryors, the Norman Lears (hiding behind Archie Bunker and George Jefferson) all said what they wanted, often on broadcast television, because they were advancing Liberal Progressive ideas. In addition, because of the idea of the 1st amendment that guaranteed freedom of speech.

Now that these same Liberals in government control the country, media, business, science and education there is no longer freedom of speech. Freedom of speech and thought has been replaced with Soviet styled propaganda and mass brainwashing techniques. This statement is not hyperbole. This statement was taken from the mouth of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder when he was a U.S. Attorney in 1995 in the Clinton administration when he speaks about over turning another Constitutional amendment that Liberals disagree, with the 2nd amendment. (see 3:29 min video)

It is clear that the tactics that A.G. Holder espoused in the above video are in play in the Barry Hussein Soetoro administration. Liberals are against both freedom of speech, if that speech is Conservative speech, and they oppose the Constitutional right to bear arms.

It is apparent that Liberals are relentless in their attacks against legitimate Constitutional rights of free speech and gun ownership. However, first on the Liberal agenda is to get Barry Hussein Soetoro reelected the way Liberals intend to do that is by killing Conservative talk radio.

Already mysteriously, the face of Conservative radio landscape is changed. Many of the prominent voices that held prime time slots prior to the 2008 elections have been either moved or removed from radio. The Conservative voices were removed stealthily so that conservative listeners would not be riled into action.

They have been replace with phony Conservatives like ones in the San Diego market, Mike Slater and Chip Franklin, Franklin openly acknowledges that he is no conservative, they replaced staunch Conservatives like Rick Rogers in that market to make the reelection of Barry Hussein more attainable.

Progressives couldn‚Äôt have the truth told about their President and their agenda in an election year. Therefore, they surreptitiously moved conservative voices out of prime time replacing them with fakes.

The Washington Post reports that the greatest attack against conservative radio is being orchestrated by the organization ‚ÄúMedia Matters‚Äù (see article)

Media Matters has taken to extremist measures but threatening advertisers of conservative radio with boycotts. Media Matters has sunk so low as to use negative publicity tactics against stations like Clear Channel and their advertisers. If owners fail to capitulate to Media Matter‚Äôs demands to silence conservative talk, they rarely do, Media Matters uses economic black mail. It is a clear effort to quash freedom of speech when that speech confronts the Social Liberal messaging that prevails throughout the country.

Therefore, if Clear Channel-owned Premiere Radio Networks and Advertisers know that they are being played by Media Matters, and they should, yet they don‚Äôt have the value set to support conservative values Conservatives should divest themselves of Clear Channel and all Liberal influenced and controlled media and advertisers.

Apparently, Media Matters wishes to split the country further along partisan lines creating a time in which one day Conservatives will only shop in conservative stores and Liberals will only shop in liberal stores.

If Clear Channel and some of it‚Äôs advertisers are going to acquiesce to the Progressive Liberal Media Matters then so be it. Maybe it is time for Conservative radio to leave Clear Channel and start their own exclusive stations and media companies.

What about it Rush instead of tea or as well as tea why not you and Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, Glenn Beck, Laura Ingram and Michael Savage, G. Gordon Liddy, Dennis Prager and any conservative that I‚Äôve might have missed look for investors and start a media corporation that would be impervious to the meddling of the likes of Media Matters?

You all believe in capitalism, you all believe in the first amendment, it‚Äôs time to leave Clear Channel before they further limit your abilities to speak freely. Right now all conservative radio has been muted we all hear it you are not free to tell the truth for fear of losing advertisers.",0,en,0

"Shannons' Present Part 1

As Miss Mandy led me into the BDSS (Big Dick Stud Service) front office she handcuffed me and led me to a chair where I was told to sit. I was only mildly nervous but completely unaware of what was going on. Miss Mandy had only told me that this was a reward for being such a good girl for the past several months and that she had purchased me a present, a rather expensive present. So I just sat quietly. I was wearing only nude crotchless hose with tiny silver sequens that reflected the light, 4‚Ä≥ strappy sandal heels and a short sleeveless black dress (Miss Mandys favorite). Miss Mandy went to the counter and talked with a receptionest and then returned to me. She bent over and kissed me deeply and then smiled at me and said ‚Äúenjoy yourself Shannon honey, I‚Äôll be back to get you later when they call me to say that you are done. That will probably be at least tomorrow.‚Äù With that she left.

It was only a few minutes later that another lady dressed much like a nurse came over to me and instructed me to follow her. I did as I was told and she led me to a room. In the room was a strange looking device with straps, stirrups and such things attached to it there were also chains hanging from the ceiling and various dildos and restraint devices on the table. All four walls and the ceiling were covered with mirrors. I was led to the center of the room and told to be still, the lady went around behind me and unzipped my dress and let it fall to the floor. ‚ÄúStep out of the dress, honey‚Äù she said so I stepped over the dress which was removed from the floor. She unlocked my hand cuffs and replaced them with some wrist and ankle straps. My hands were then fastened to two of the chains that were hanging from the ceiling. ‚ÄúSpread your legs a bit, Shannon, I‚Äôm going to pole you right quick‚Äù. ‚ÄúPole me???‚Äù I asked. This lady then grabs my nipples and squeezes and twists causing me to grunt in pain. ‚ÄúShut up, bitch, you will only speak when spoken to!! I know that you don‚Äôt know what being poled is but you are about to find out right now!‚Äù With my legs spread some she pushes a button on a remote that she had in her hand and a pole comes up through the floor, on top of the pole a dildo was mounted. She guides the dildo into my pussy and I feel it penetrate me deeply as I gasp involutarily. Once inserted she tightens the chains on my arms and I am held with my arms out at about a 45 degree angle and a dildo in my cunt. ‚ÄúThis is poled, hon, see with you in heels you are already on your tip toes, there is no way for you to get off of the dildo. I could actually release your hands and you would be stuck there until someone withdraws your dildo. Kind of neat isin‚Äôt it?‚Äù I did not answer. ‚ÄúNice tits‚Äù she says as she massages my left breast a bit. ‚ÄúYep, those tits will draw a lot of attention around here. Anyway, my name is Monica and I will be your matron during your stay here at BDSS. Miss Mandy Carpenter has purchased a delux treatment for you. Let me explain what that means. It is our top of the line treatment, it is very expensive so we don‚Äôt get many girls like you, that means that you will have almost constant attention. What kind of attention you would ask? Well, hon you are going to be fucked in every possible position and orafice in your body, vaginally, annaly and orally. There will be some other females that will play with you but mostly it will be the men. Sometimes the guys may get a little rough with you but I can assure you that you will not be seriously harmed in any way. It says here that you like being bound and fucked, well thats good because our guys love that.‚Äù She then pushes another button on the remote and I feel a gush in my pussy ‚Äúugh‚Äù I respond. ‚ÄúThat‚Äù Monica said ‚Äòis a special lubricant for your pussy. It is quite pleasing, you will feel a tingling sensation inside and an almost menthol like cooling on your labia, most girls really enjoy it. It also makes you incredibly horny‚Äù she smiled at me. Another push of the button another gush. I began to feel the tingling combined with cooling on my labia I began to try to fuck myself on the dildo but it was in so deep that I could not get much motion at all. I was getting incredibly horny. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Shannon dear, I will have you fucked in just a few minutes. Wait here and a guy will be in to service you shortly‚Äù having said that Miss Monica left the room. As I stood there looking at my reflection I noticed that my pussy was getting very warm and wet with the tingling I was about to explode but I could not cum by myself without stimulation. It was only a couple of minutes before the door opened and a guy walked in, he was muscular, tall, tanned and already rock hard. His cock looked to be at least 10 inches long and I ghasped at the sight of him. He comes to me and cups my chin with one hand and my right breast with the other. He looks at me and says ‚ÄúGreat tits, bitch, and you are even a good looking cunt. It will be a pleasure to fuck you‚Äù. He unlocks my hands and lifts me off of the dildo. He puts me down spins me around so that I am facing away from him, he then pushes on my back as I bend over he inserts his cock into me fully and pauses. ‚ÄúAAGGHH‚Äù I moan as he impales me. He chuckles and says ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get used to it honey‚Äù as he begins to fuck me. He felt GLORIOUS sliding deeply in and out of my pussy. I came almost immediatly as his pace quickened squirting my fluid mostly on the floor as I was facing away from him. Grasping the side of the table for support I feel the force of his thrusts pounding on my butt. He was fucking me so hard and for so long that I thought he would surely cum soon but he didnt, his pace slowed after a while and he finally withdrew his cock from me. I felt a mixture of relief and regret‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I never feel that I have pleased my man unless he cums somewhere in or on me. ‚ÄúMONICA!!!‚Äù he shouts and Miss Monica enters the room, ‚Äúyes sir?‚Äù she replies. ‚ÄúHave this bitch bound face up so that we can fuck her properly, Im going to get Jerry, he‚Äôll really like this one, she‚Äôs deep, wet, hot and you know how he likes girls with big tits.‚Äù Having said that he left the room. My hands went to my pussy as I began rubbing myself. Miss Monica smiles at me and says ‚Äúnice feeling isin‚Äôt it?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes mame‚Äù I reply. She then moves my hand away from my cunt and inserts another of the squirting dildos‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Gush‚Ä¶‚Ä¶more lubricant‚Ä¶.‚ÄùAAHHGGhh‚Äù I felt just like a man cuming in me. She withdraws the dildo and takes me by the hand and leads to the front of the table. Before proceeding she takes me in her arms and kisses me with a deep french kiss, I moan softly at her gentle probing with her tounge , the feel of her arms around me and the renewed tingling in my cunt. After a long wonderful kiss she says, ‚Äúhop up on the table Shannon put your butt on the pad. I‚Äôve got to tie you up so that you can be fucked some more. I told you that those tits of yours were going to draw attention, we don‚Äôt usually tag team you girls until later in the day.‚Äù I get on the table as instructed as Miss Monica secures my legs spread wide and my arms are secured above my head. She then takes 2 smaller chains that are dangling from the ceiling and I see that there are nipple clamps on the ends. She attaches the clamps to my nipples and raises the chains, as the chains rise my nipples are pulled upward raising my tits as well, I grunt softly as my tits are pulled to the point of pain. A wide strap is placed across my tummy to keep me from sliding on the table. Two other girls enter the room, pull off their panties with one on each side of me they bend over as two guys enter the room and immediatly begin to fuck the girls. I was not sure what was going on but I was about to find out. The guy that was fucking me before enters the room with another guy (pesumably Jerry) and they turn to Miss Monica and say ‚ÄúNice job, Monica, as usual‚Äù Miss Monica bends down and kisses me again then she smiles and says ‚Äúenjoy, hon, I‚Äôll be back to lick your pussy when they are done with you.‚Äù as she leaves the room. I look down my body and see
Jerry insert his
cock into me, I moan loudly at the penetration as these guys had HUGE cocks. ‚ÄúOh yeah, I like this one‚Äù says Jerry as he begins to fuck me slowly at first sliding in and out I cum hard, squirting his tummy with my juices. The restraint, penetration and pain in my tits were working together to get me so horny that I was almost delerious. Jerry quickens his pace fucking me fast and furiously. So hard that my tits were trying to flop around causing the chains to tug at my nipples intensifying the pain but it did not seem to matter as pain and pleasure were melding together. One of the guys that was fucking one of the other girls withdraws from her and comes to my head, inserts his cock into my mouth and explodes immediatly, filling my mouth with his semen. The smell and taste of his cum contributed to another huge orgasm as Jerry was till pounding me hard, I tried to swallow at least some of his cum but I could barely breath, never mind that another cock was slid into my mouth and exploded with even more cum. As soon as he withdrew from my mouth one of the girls began kissing me, she slid her hand to my clit and fingered me until I came again in a wild, extemely intense orgasm. Just as I was starting to recover I felt Jerry withdraw from me but he was replaced with the other guy who continued to fuck me. The feel of his cock sliding deep into my cunt, withdrawing and penetrating to the deepest parts of my womanhood was almost overwelming, that combined with my restaints and the tugging on my nipples sent me into an almost semiconcious state of euphoria. I felt waves of pleasure coarsing through my body, I began to see flashes of light as orgasm after orgasm gripped me. I could hear the voice of a woman almost screaming in pleasure but I did not realize or recognize that it was my own. I had never before been so deeply, completely and intensly fucked. I had absolutly no idea how long these guys had been fucking me or how long I had been in multiple orgasms, my entire being was imersed in total overwhelming pleasure. I felt the cocks in my pussy change many times as the guys were tag teaming me, when one would get tired he would just withdraw and another would take over driving me to the edge of sanity. I felt the pace begin to slow at some point as the guys were beginning to ease up some. Slowly they slowed down as I began to recover the only sound in the room was the squishing sound from my pussy as his cock slid in and out of me. I opened my eyes and saw four guys standing around me, thier cooks all stiff and wet. The guy that was fucking me grunted a bit as I felt him explode in my cunt, my god it felt like a fire hose was deep in me spewing white hot fluid. My eyes rolled into my head as I ghasped loudly. He withdrew and another inserted his cock into me and exploded, spewing his semen, filling me. I came again in another intense orgasm spraying my fluids mixed with semen on his tummy as he withdrew from me. Then the third and fourth guys cum in me. As I lay there panting hard I feel fluid dripping down my butt and I know that they have filled me as completely as a woman can be filled.

Miss Monica enters the room as the guys were leaving and comes to me ‚ÄúHave a good time???‚Äù she says smiling. ‚ÄúDear god‚Äù I reply. ‚ÄúThese guys know how to please a girl, thats for sure. Would you like me to release you now?‚Äù she asks. ‚ÄúMiss Monica please leave me like this for a bit, I feel so‚Ä¶.so‚Ä¶.fucked and satisfied‚Äù I replied and I just liked being tied and restrained like that. My legs spread wide, arms held tightly and my tits were actually tingling a little from the nipple restraint and the pounding that I had taken. ‚ÄúVery well, Shannon‚Äù she says as she leans down and kisses me in a long deep and passionate kiss. ‚ÄúYou know, hon, you have two other holes that we need to explore but first you need a break. I will be back in about an hour to untie you and let you rest for a bit then we will go to the anal room. We have some guys with some very nice cocks for butt fucking.‚Äù she says as she leaves the room.",1,en,1

"Greens leader Richard Di Natale has declared he would ""relish"" the chance to serve as health minister in a future Labor-Greens coalition government, and suggested colleagues such as Larissa Waters could also serve in cabinet in charge of portfolios such as environment.

The ambition, revealed in an exclusive interview with Fairfax Media to mark Senator Di Natale's impending six month anniversary as leader, came as Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull met the Greens leader for the first time on Thursday, in a clear sign of the new Liberal Prime Minister's determination to reach out to the crossbench and advance his government's agenda.

In the interview, Senator Di Natale said his personal view was it would be a mistake to enter into a formal, permanent alliance with Labor akin to the Liberal-National Coalition but ""I think we can enter into an arrangement with the Labor party to support them in government in the same way we have [in 2010] ‚Äì you offer confidence and ask for key policy outcomes and you do that election by election,"" he said.

""We should be open to cabinet posts, we have done that already in Tasmania and the ACT. My view is you are in politics to get outcomes. I would relish the opportunity to be a health minister in a future government ... why couldn't we see [Senator] Larissa Waters as an environment minister in a future government?""",0,en,0

"Time course of calcium transients derived from Fura-2 fluorescence measurements in single fast twitch fibres of adult mice and rat myotubes developing in primary culture.
In this study, we applied a method to correct for the altered binding kinetics of Fura-2 for Ca2+ in vivo, on Ca2+ fluorescence transients (Ca2+F) measured using Fura-2 in single adult fast twitch skeletal muscle fibres of the mouse, which exhibit very fast [Ca2+] responses, and rat myotubes developing in culture which exhibit slower [Ca2+] responses (rise time [20-80% of peak] of Ca2+F transients: 1.81 +/- 0.17 ms and 16.14 +/- 2.60 ms, respectively). After correction, the [Ca2+] transients (Ca2+C) measured in both the adult mouse fibres and the myotubes rose more rapidly (mean rise time of Ca2+C transients: adult mouse fibres, 0.76 +/- 0.12 ms; rat myotubes, 8.25 +/- 2.83 ms) and often exhibited a Ca2+ spike which exceeded the peak of the Ca2+F transient. In the adult mouse fibres, correction increased the mean peak [Ca2+] of the Ca2+F transients by a factor of 7 from 0.53 +/- 0.08 microM to 3.76 +/- 0.71 microM. The accuracy of the time course of the corrected Ca2+ transients was confirmed by comparison to the time course of Ca2+ transients measured with Mag-Fura-5, which had a similar mean rise time (0.94 +/- 0.10 ms, t-test, P = 0.80). The more slowly rising Ca2+ transients measured in the rat myotubes were less affected by the correction process, increasing in mean peak [Ca2+] by a factor of only 1.2 from 0.82 +/- 0.17 microM to 0.97 +/- 0.15 microM.

"I love the PC and all it stands for: openness, performance, innovation, and variety. The PC has something for everyone, and it can do so many things that other devices can't‚Äîdon't get me started on games. Since the late '90s, desktops and laptops have gotten better in design. Gone are the days of beige boxes. During my early days of the PC, desktops weren't even standing towers. Instead, they all laid flat, and all of them had the quintessential turbo button on them.

Then, there was an evolution in design. Companies started producing products that were different‚Äîeven attractive. Laptops started introducing exotic materials and desktops came in varying shapes and colors. Then something very strange happened.

After the the advent of the modern smartphone in 2007 and subsequently the modern tablet, desktop PC sales were hit hard. Every year since then, we've seen the recurring reports of declining PC sales. In fact, the decline of the PC has been a running joke for a decade now. All the major PC companies panicked and many even bailed out of the consumer desktop space completely.

At the same time however, PC gaming was growing. Gamers demanded more hardware, more performance, and were quick to show their pride on the PC's resilience, especially versus consoles, which suffer from being spec-locked for years. There was a surge of interest from manufacturers to go all-in to PC gaming. And then, things started looking ugly.

These days, anything that doesn't have outrageous design language isn't called a gaming product. And anything that is called a gaming product somehow seems to look ridiculous. But a picture speaks a thousand words:

Above is a photo of a headphone stand. It's simple, sturdy, made of metal, and does its job well. Its design is well thought through‚Äîproviding a curve in the support pad for the curve in your headset or headphone.

Now here's a ""gaming"" headphone stand:

That's the result I get on Amazon when I amend my search for ""headphone stand"" to ""gaming headphone stand."" What the fuck?

The abominations don't end there. We see this sort of design language through the entire industry. Everything from motherboards, to graphics cards, to monitors, to headsets and more. Instead of making things efficient and comfortable, ridiculous and often useless design language takes a front row seat.

I spoke with several major motherboard manufacturers and they all admit to one thing: huge and wild heatsinks don't do jack for cooling the motherboard. In fact, they're more inefficient than straight up normal heatsinks, and cost more to use.

Think the heatsink on the above motherboard is better for your cooling? Think again. The only thing it did was make heat dissipation less effective and increase the price you have to pay. I'd take the heatsink used on server motherboards any day‚Äîyou know, the ones in machines that have to handle brutal workloads and stay alive 24/7? Here's an example:

And in case you don't think you're paying extra for all the gimmicks, you're wrong. The more effective heatsinks on server motherboards‚Äîthat need to handle more demanding environments‚Äîcosts less to manufacture than the (un)cooler heatsink block of metal seen on virtually all gaming motherboards. This is because the tooling and molds needed to produce more complicated designs also cost more to make.

My favorite keyboard company, Das Keyboard, once proud of being the elite, simple, and understated, is now on the same trend. I'm scratching my head in an attempt to figure out how one of these keyboards below is made for gamers and the other is not:

Can you tell which model is for gaming? It's really easy: the one with the funky design and the RGB lighting. But even Das Keyboard's own gaming series isn't as daring as this one:

Don't get me started with RGB lighting. It's everywhere I look and it seems like we're on a path to no return. Speakers are lit, keyboards are lit, motherboards are lit, RAM is lit, headsets are lit‚Äîeverything is lit. One day I'm going to have a damn seizure. Heck, even ""gaming"" chairs are starting to feature RGB lighting.

Admittedly there are folks who light up their rigs tastefully, and they do look great. But when did insane designs and RGB equate to gaming? Are manufacturers telling us that in order to perform well in a game we have to have RGB lighting and that whatever products we buy have to have fins and jagged edges? Why can't a gaming product be simple, effective, and perform well? Does the computer case I use need to have flaps, fins and bulges to convey that the size of my ""e-peen"" is substantial? Does RGB lighting deliver a higher chance of a stable overclock? Give me a break.

So what is PC gaming? It's really simple: gaming means having good graphics and CPU performance to get the best experience out of your games. Gaming means decreased load times and higher clock frequencies. Gaming means optimizing a system to speed up texture loads, and using high refresh-rate displays. It means having low latency and no network lag. It does not mean adding more junk onto PC hardware or making uncomfortable design choices in the name of‚Äîugly‚Äîaesthetics.

The last two trade shows I went to were utterly disappointing. Nearly everyone was showcasing crazier designs and more RGB lighting. I saw a bit of innovation, such as 8K displays, high-refresh 4K displays, faster networking, and other technologies that improve my gaming experience in meaningful ways. But most companies were all about flashy lights. I haven't even touched on gaming laptop and gaming desktop designs.

All the manufacturers I spoke to recently tell me that anything RGB will sell more than the equivalent non-RGB product. More effort is being diverted into design rather than actual hardware improvements. Is this really what PC gamers want?",1,en,1

 Fantastic work! 

One of my friends passed along a comment from a professor's class notes about this article (it is required reading for the class). I thought it would be nice to share it here:

Great work! )   

I agree this article is really good now.206.109.195.126  

 Image from WMAP press release, 2006 

This image is quite puzzling and deserves a wider comment. I believe that the grid is physically correct but the image of the CMBR on the left as a surface (rather than as a circle) and the representation of stars as points rather than geodesics, are simply artist concepts and readers should be warned. Any objection against pointing out the ambiguity of an image from a qualified source? Do you believe they are really correct?   

(Image copied here for easier reference) I have mixed feelings. On the one hand it's one of those pictures that's """"pretty"""" but doesn't do a great job of illustrating the actual science. On the other hand it could do a lot worse. I'm still trying to figure out what the scale (radius of the circular cross-sections) is supposed to represent. It's not the FRW scale factor because then the inflationary epoch and the CMB would be invisible (smaller than a pixel). Then I thought it was the comoving radius of the observable universe, but then it shouldn't flare outward on the right or have that point on the left (the graph of the comoving radius can only be concave upward if the universe is shrinking). Maybe it's the scale factor with a significant amount of distortion to make the early eras visible, but then the """"Inflation"""" label is pointing to the wrong place‚Äîit should be pointing basically where """"Quantum Fluctuations"""" is pointing. Or it could be the log of the scale factor, but that has the same problems as the comoving radius.

The illustration of the evolution of the galaxies is kind of cool, and could perhaps be justified by saying that they took slices of the universe of nonzero thickness at intervals of, say, 100 million years and stacked those on top of each other. That would explain the lack of continuous world lines. Are people going to get that? I don't know.

"STI Testing and Counseling

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can happen to anyone who is sexually active. While appropriate screenings can detectthem, it is not uncommon for STIs to present few or mild symptoms. For this reason, young women who are sexually active are encouraged to see a gynecologist every year for routine screenings. The immediate goal of screening for STIs is to identify and treat patients who have STIs before the infections are able to cause any additional complications. Secondary infections, such as Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), can develop if STIs are left untreated for an extended period of time. PID usually occurs when a bacteria from a sexually transmitted infection spreads from the vaginal area to the uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries. Untreated PID can cause complications, such as recurring pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancies, and even infertility. When diagnosed early on, however, many of these complications can be avoided.

Yes

> detachable magazine 

Yes, in fact it came from the factory with two 12 round clips

> a pistol grip

Yep.

 Just browsing these at present, but on this page of his Statement of Facts a very different British claim-line is shown from the one on the map currently on this article.  Begg's main points of difference are that the original treaty (1825) specified Cape Chacon, not Cape Muzon, as the start of the boundary line, and that the terms Portland Channel and Portland Canal were deliberately confused by the US, with the meaning of Portland Channel in 1825 referring to Clarence Strait, not the Portland Canal which was unknown at the time; Etolin Island he notes as having originally been Duke of York Island, also.  Begg wrote three treatises on this, most with all the same points, though successively in 1896, 1900 and 1902, all official reports with two (1896 and 1902) written to federal and provincial cabeint ministers, respectively.  Another item in Begg that's passed over here and in other histories is the Ukase of 1821 which claimed to 51 degrees N and also involved the Bering Sea Arbitration.

"Before watching Netflix‚Äôs crime documentary series ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer‚Äù, I wasn‚Äôt expecting that such an ordinary internet law could be so powerful to hunt down a brutal killer.

I know I know this new docuseries by Netflix is too depressing for so many of you and I won‚Äôt recommend to them at all.

However, apart from murderous and fiendish acts in the documentary, It is pleasing too since it shows how young internet nerds become online detectives to hunt down an internet killer named ‚ÄúLuka Magnotta‚Äù in Berlin in 2012 as he broke the ‚ÄúRule Zero‚Äù which says ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fuck with cats or we‚Äôll find you‚Äù.

The series portrays how young group of online detectives uncovered the identity of retarded person who published clips of himself brutally killing the kittens on the internet. The video titled ‚Äú1 boy 2 kittens‚Äù depicts him killing kittens by putting them in plastic bags and suffocating them by sucking out air using a vacuum cleaner.

Another clip shows him feeding other kittens to a python. And he didn‚Äôt stop posting distressing videos of torturing animals, until eventually he killed his lover.

He killed his lover with an ice perk, mercilessly cut the body in small parts and ate some of them and then delivered a foot and hand to political offices in Canada.

With the remarkable investigation by online nerds ‚ÄúLuka Magnotta‚Äù was charged with first degree murder, committing an indignity to a dead body, publishing obscene material, mailing obscene material and criminally harassing Prime Minister Stephen Harper and other members of Parliament.

And currently, he is jailed at Archambault Institution in Quebec. So many Netflix viewers get really upset after watching the documentary and many of them demand to unpublished the content as soon as possible on Twitter.

Many binge-watchers pleased with this documentary and one of them rated as the best killer documentary ever:

#DontFuckWithCats is the best killer documentary I‚Äôve watched in a while but also brutal. Fuck that cunt Luka Magnotta ‚Äî lee cooper (@leecoops_) December 18, 2019

Don‚Äôt F**k With Cats on #Netflix today about the murderer Luka Magnotta. Gripping stuff! It seems wrong to say ‚ÄúI really enjoyed it‚Äù when it‚Äôs about such a horrible person but‚Ä¶ yeah I really enjoyed it.#LukaMagnotta #dontfuckwithcats pic.twitter.com/wf3H3ZlaoT ‚Äî Dean Greer (@ThatDeanGreer) December 18, 2019

Though, some of Netflix subscribers tweeted don‚Äôt watch this docuseries at all since it is providing fame to the killer and this documentary is doing that:

PSA: don‚Äôt watch the documentary ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt F*** with Cats‚Äù on Netflix Canada about murderer, Luka Magnotta (POS). He only wanted notoriety and this film does just that. ‚Äî nicole? (@nicolesands_) December 18, 2019

Yeahhhh I don‚Äôt plan on watching the Luka Magnotta Netflix doc. They‚Äôre basically giving him a platform of fame that he‚Äôs always wanted, and I‚Äôm not contributing to it. Fuck that cat killing, ice pick murdering scum bag. ‚Äî the repugnant one ???? (@jakeisrepugnant) December 10, 2019

Currently, this docuseries is available in 20 countries on Netflix including USA, UK, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Canada, Hungary, Iceland, India, Israel, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand and Turkey.

So if you want to watch this new brutal and controversial series on Netflix, you need to be reside in one of the mentioned above countries or read my blog on how to get US Netflix from anywhere in the world under 5 minutes.

So is this documentary depressing or pleasing one for you? Let me know by shouting out your thoughts in the comment section below.",1,en,1

"Quotes by Ozzy Osbourne

John Michael ""Ozzy"" Osbourne was born 3 December 1948. He is a British singer. Osbourne's career as a musician has spanned over four decades. He rose to prominence as lead vocalist of the English heavy metal band Black Sabbath (originally named Earth). Black Sabbath's great success helped start the heavy metal genre. After the bands break-up, Ozzy went on to achieved a multi-platinum, award-winning solo career.

In the early 2000s, his career as a celebrity revived when he became a star in his own reality show, The Osbournes which also starred his wife, Sharon, and two of his children (Kelly and Jack). In August 2008, Osbourne is quoted in the USA Today to have said he intends to retire after recording two more albums.

Ozzy Osbourne is known as the Godfather of Heavy Metal as well as the Prince of Darkness.

The down side of being outrageous is that you have to go around explaining your fucking self to people. If you're too cocky, somebody might just pull out a fucking gun and cock it and blow your fucking face off. You gotta be really careful what you bite off. Don't bite off more than you can chew. It's a dangerous world.I don't consider myself a great singer--but I have a connection with the audience. There's the artist, and then a void and the audience; but I like to be part of the audience. I'd like to be them, and I'd like them to be me for an hour and a half. I get criticized for being the antichrist, causing kids to commit suicide, but that's total bullsh-t. My intentions are not that. Every year they have Halloween, and all I do is take Halloween night out on the road every night. It's like a Halloween party every night. If that was the case on Halloween night, the police cells would be full--everyone would have turned Satanic for the night!.I have a saying. 'Never judge a book by its cover'. I say that because I don't even know who Ozzy is. I wake up a new person every day. But if you've got a fantasy of Ozzy, who am I to say? I mean, if you think I sleep upside-down in the rafters and fly around at night and bite people's throats out, then that's your thing. But I can tell you now, all I ever wanted was for people to come to my concerts and have a good time. I don't want anyone to harm themselves in any way, shape or form-and my intentions are good whether people want to believe it or not. I'm not going to suddenly become a Jesus freak or anything. But I do have my beliefs and my beliefs are certainly not satanic.It took a lot of water to down just that fucking bat's head, let me tell you. It's still stuck in my fucking throat, after all these years. People all over the world say, 'You're the guy who kills creatures? You still do it? You do it every night?' It happened fucking once, for Christ's sake.I've had every known chemical--cocaine, booze--and tobacco is the hardest one in the world for me to quit. You watch old flicks? It's suggestion by looking at something: You see a cigarette, and it makes you want to smoke!Bubbles! Oh come on Sharon! I'm fucking Ozzy Osbourne, I'm the Prince of fucking Darkness. Evil! Evil! What's fucking evil about a shitload of bubbles!?I want to be American. America is the coolest place on the face of the Earth. You've got freedom of speech. You've got McDonald's.I kept hearing that metal is dead and Ozzy's dead and people that like Ozzy are dead. I have never had an empty seat. I've always sold out, so who's saying it's all over?I can honestly say, all the bad things that ever happened to me were directly, directly attributed to drugs and alcohol.

Too many self-styled experts on communism, without valid credentials and without any access whatsoever to classified factual data regarding the inner workings of the conspiracy, have engaged in rumor-mongering and hurling false and wholly unsubstantiated allegations against persons whose views differ from their own. This is dangerous business. It is divisive and unintelligent, and makes more difficult the task of the professional investigator.""

"Brett Le Man

Brett Le Man (born 15 April 1962) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s and 1990s.

Background
While attending Cooparoo High School, Le Man played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1979.

Playing career
The curly-haired back-rower played in the Brisbane Rugby League (BRL) for the Easts Tigers and Brisbane Brothers, winning a first-grade premiership with both clubs (Easts 1983, Brothers 1987). Le Man went on to play for the Brisbane Broncos between 1988 and 1991, notching up 38 games and scoring 9 tries. He scored the Broncos' first ever try in a premiership match. It was against Manly and he scored from the scraps of a Craig Grauf bomb.

Post playing
Le Man now owns his own company and has two kids.

If you live in the RTD taxing district, then the first 24 hours at the park-n-ride at Lincoln Station is free. It costs $4 only if you don't live in the RTD taxing district, which means you are not paying taxes for RTD. All these prices are from the RTD website. I don't know where you can find all-day parking for $5; the lowest that I could find was $9.

"Any time Pope Francis talks with reporters on the papal plane, you know something interesting is about to happen. This time was no exception.

What strikes me about his comments isn't that he said anything new (he mostly reiterated traditional Catholic teaching on gender identity), but that he resisted making a blanket condemnation or speaking negatively about transgender people. Instead, he went where he usually does, encouraging personal dialogue, pastoral sensitivity and taking each situation as it comes.

I can't help but contrast that with the knee-jerk way many U.S. bishops have dealt with the issue. I wish they'd take a page from Francis' book and let their default mode be one of conversation rather than edict. It could only improve their low stock with U.S. Catholics.

"Ixodid and argasid ticks. Keys to their identification.
Ticks of the Ixodidae family are important ectoparasites of humans and animals. Of the 80 or so species found in the United States, about 20 are of veterinary importance. Ticks are second only to mosquitoes as carriers of human pathogens. The ixodid (or hard) ticks are the most common and are represented by the genera Ixodes, Haemaphysalis, Boophilus, Rhipicephalus, Amblyomma, and Dermacentor. Accurate identification of the species of ixodid ticks within an area is a prerequisite to control and eradication. Therefore, veterinarians should have a working knowledge of the biology and identity of the more common mammalian-parasitizing ticks in the United States. In the United States, the argasid (or soft) ticks are less common than the ixodid (or hard) ticks. Argasids are represented by the genera Argas, Ornithodoros, and Otobius. Although the overall anatomy of the various species of argasids is similar, their functional approaches to feeding, reproduction, host finding and preference, tick-host behavior, tick relationship to their environment, and disease association vary among species. Accurate identification of the species of argasid ticks within an area is useful in their control.",0,en,0

"Q:

Android ""speak failed: not bound to tts engine""

My android application has text to speak feature and more then one activity uses this feature. So created a static helper class to made this easy.
import java.util.Locale;

import android.content.Context;
import android.speech.tts.TextToSpeech;
import android.speech.tts.TextToSpeech.OnInitListener;
import android.util.Log;

public class TextToSpeechController implements OnInitListener {

    private static final String TAG = ""TextToSpeechController"";
    private TextToSpeech myTTS;
    private String textToSpeak;
    private Context context;

    private static TextToSpeechController singleton;

    public static TextToSpeechController getInstance(Context ctx) {
        if (singleton == null)
            singleton = new TextToSpeechController(ctx);
        return singleton;
    }

    private TextToSpeechController(Context ctx) {
        context = ctx;
    }

    public void speak(String text) {
        textToSpeak = text;

        if (myTTS == null) {
            // currently can't change Locale until speech ends
            try {
                // Initialize text-to-speech. This is an asynchronous operation.
                // The OnInitListener (second argument) is called after
                // initialization completes.
                myTTS = new TextToSpeech(context, this);

            } catch (Exception e) {             
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        sayText();

    }

    public void onInit(int initStatus) {
        if (initStatus == TextToSpeech.SUCCESS) {
            if (myTTS.isLanguageAvailable(Locale.UK) == TextToSpeech.LANG_AVAILABLE)
                myTTS.setLanguage(Locale.UK);
        }

        // status can be either TextToSpeech.SUCCESS or TextToSpeech.ERROR.
        if (initStatus == TextToSpeech.SUCCESS) {
            int result = myTTS.setLanguage(Locale.UK);
            if (result == TextToSpeech.LANG_MISSING_DATA
                    || result == TextToSpeech.LANG_NOT_SUPPORTED) {
                Log.e(TAG, ""TTS missing or not supported ("" + result + "")"");
                // Language data is missing or the language is not supported.
                // showError(R.string.tts_lang_not_available);

            } else {
                // Initialization failed.
                Log.e(TAG, ""Error occured"");
            }

        }
    }

    private void sayText() {
        // ask TTs to say the text
        myTTS.speak(this.textToSpeak, TextToSpeech.QUEUE_FLUSH,     null);
    }

    public void stopTTS() {
        if (myTTS != null) {
            myTTS.shutdown();
            myTTS.stop();
            myTTS = null;
        }
    }

}

I am using this helper class like this.
TextToSpeechController.getInstance(this).speak(readableMessage);

But sometimes i see an error like line beloew at LogCat.
""speak:failed not bound to tts engine""

No exception thrown but nothing readed by TTS.
I realized that if i triggered activity from BroadcastReceiver, i got this error. Otherwise if manually open activity from application code works with no problem.
Here is the BroadcastReceiver code
private final BroadcastReceiver mHandleMessageReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        String newMessage = intent.getExtras().getString(EXTRA_MESSAGE);            
        String readableMessage = intent.getExtras().getString(READABLE_MESSAGE);    

        Bundle b = new Bundle();
        b.putString(EXTRA_MESSAGE, newMessage);
        b.putString(READABLE_MESSAGE, readableMessage);
        Intent newIntent = new Intent(""android.intent.action.MAIN"");
        newIntent.setClass(context, Speak.class);
        newIntent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
        newIntent.putExtra(""MessageReceived"", b);
        newIntent.putExtra(""CallType"", CallType.NOTIFICATION);
        context.startActivity(newIntent);           
    }
};

A:

Your code is not waiting for the asynch return from the constructor of the TextToSpeech class.  You even have a comment that says it is asynch.  Why it always fails in the Receiver but not the Activity I am not sure - other then maybe the Activity as a foreground task has higher priority and it happen to complete before you call sayText.
You need to wait to call sayText until the init call returns in the case where it has to new up a new TTS object.

A:

Here is the code I use for text to speech. For my code simply type speakWords(""say something""); in any activity. 
public class VoiceRecognition extends Activity implements OnClickListener,
        OnInitListener {

    public static final int VOICE_RECOGNITION_REQUEST_CODE = 1234;

    public Button speakButton;
    // TTS object
    public TextToSpeech myTTS;
    // status check code
    public int MY_DATA_CHECK_CODE = 0;

    // setup TTS
    public void onInit(int initStatus) {

        // check for successful instantiation
        if (initStatus == TextToSpeech.SUCCESS) {
            if (myTTS.isLanguageAvailable(Locale.US) == TextToSpeech.LANG_AVAILABLE)
                myTTS.setLanguage(Locale.US);
        } else if (initStatus == TextToSpeech.ERROR) {
            Toast.makeText(this, ""Sorry! Text To Speech failed..."",
                    Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        }
    }

"On Stage and in the Movies

On Stage and in the Movies is Dionne Warwick's seventh album for Scepter Records, and was recorded and released in 1967. The LP was issued as number 559 in the Scepter Catalog.

History
The cover art for this LP was simple: Warwick in a multicolored gown against a black background.  As mentioned in the liner notes of the Rhino Records 1984 collection Dionne Warwick Anthology, this LP was one of three concept albums recorded by Warwick during her tenure with Scepter.  The other two albums identified in the notes are Soulful and The Magic of Believing.

While there were no hit singles from this album, some of the songs that were featured were ""Summertime""; a humorous reading of ""Anything You Can Do"" (alongside an uncredited Chuck Jackson); ""You'll Never Walk Alone""; ""Something Wonderful"", and ""Baubles, Bangles, and Beads"".

The album, like most of Warwick's Scepter work, was arranged by Burt Bacharach and produced by Bacharach and Hal David; however, none of the material on the album was written by the songwriting duo.

"IoT Sensors and Actuators

In this post, We talk about Basic ‚ÄúIoT Sensors and Actuators‚Äù that are used for IoT projects. So we are trying to provide a list of basic sensors and actuators for build any IoT projects. Lets explore some of the commonly used IoT Sensors and Actuators in IoT Applications.

Above picture is an Equation of Internet of things. IoT Sensors and Actuators plays main role in any IoT Projects. Without IoT Sensors and Actuators, there‚Äôs no IoT.

IoT Sensors and Actuators

IoT Sensors

Generally speaking, a sensor is a device that is able to detect changes in an environment. By itself, a sensor is useless, but when we use it in an electronic system, it plays a key role. A sensor is able to measure a physical phenomenon (like temperature, pressure, and so on) and transform it into an electric signal. So Sensors are hardware components that can detect events or changes in its surroundings, and then provide a corresponding output. Sensors are the eyes and ears of any IoT Project. Without sensors, there‚Äôs no IoT.

Lets explore some of the commonly used sensors in IoT Applications.

1. Temperature Sensors:

The TMP35/TMP36/TMP37 are low voltage, precision centigrade temperature sensors. They provide a voltage output that is linearly proportional to the Celsius (centigrade) temperature. The TMP35/ TMP36/TMP37 do not require any external calibration to provide typical accuracies of ¬±1¬∞C at +25¬∞C and ¬±2¬∞C over the ‚àí40¬∞C to +125¬∞C temperature range.

The LM35 series are precision integrated-circuit temperature devices with an output voltage linearly-proportional to the Centigrade temperature. The LM35 device has an advantage over linear temperature sensors calibrated in Kelvin, as the user is not required to subtract a large constant voltage from the output to obtain convenient Centigrade scaling. The LM35 device does not require any external calibration or trimming to provide typical accuracies of ¬±¬º¬∞C at room temperature and ¬±¬æ¬∞C over a full ‚àí55¬∞C to 150¬∞C temperature range.

The DS18B20 digital thermometer provides 9-bit to 12-bit Celsius temperature measurements and has an alarm function with nonvolatile user-programmable upper and lower trigger points. The DS18B20 communicates over a 1-Wire bus that by definition requires only one data line (and ground) for communication with a central microprocessor.

This sealed digital temperature probe lets you precisely measure temperatures in wet environments with a simple 1-Wire interface. The DS18B20 provides 9 to 12-bit (configurable) temperature readings over a 1-Wire interface, so that only one wire (and ground) needs to be connected from a central microprocessor.

2. Temperature and Humidity Sensors:

The DHT11 is a basic, ultra low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed). Its fairly simple to use, but requires careful timing to grab data. The only real downside of this sensor is you can only get new data from it once every 2 seconds, so when using our library, sensor readings can be up to 2 seconds old.

The DHT22 is a basic, low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed). It‚Äôs fairly simple to use, but requires careful timing to grab data. The only real downside of this sensor is you can only get new data from it once every 2 seconds, so when using our library, sensor readings can be up to 2 seconds old.

Simply connect the first pin on the left to 3-5V power, the second pin to your data input pin and the rightmost pin to ground. Although it uses a single-wire to send data it is not Dallas One Wire compatible! If you want multiple sensors, each one must have its own data pin.

3. Temperature, Humidity and Barometric Pressure Sensors:

The BME280 is as combined digital humidity, pressure and temperature sensor based on proven sensing principles. Its small dimensions and its low power consumption allow the implementation in battery driven devices such as handsets, GPS modules or watches. The BME280 achieves high performance in all applications requiring humidity and pressure measurement.

4. Temperature, Altitude and Barometric Pressure Sensors:

The BME280 is an integrated environmental sensor developed specifically for mobile applications where size and low power consumption are key design constraints. The unit combines individual high linearity, high accuracy sensors for pressure, humidity and temperature in an 8-pin metal-lid 2.5 x 2.5 x 0.93 mm¬≥ LGA package, designed for low current consumption (3.6 ŒºA @1Hz), long term stability and high EMC robustness.

The humidity sensor features an extremely fast response time which supports performance requirements for emerging applications such as context awareness, and high accuracy over a wide temperature range. The pressure sensor is an absolute barometric pressure sensor with features exceptionally high accuracy and resolution at very low noise. The integrated temperature sensor has been optimized for very low noise and high resolution. It is primarily used for temperature compensation of the pressure and humidity sensors, and can also be used for estimating ambient temperature.

MPL3115A2 has a wide operating range of 20 kPa to 110 kPa, a rangethat covers all surface elevations on earth. The MEMS is temperature compensatedutilizing an on-chip temperature sensor. The pressure and temperature data is fed intoa high resolution ADC to provide fully compensated and digitized outputs for pressurein Pascals and temperature in ¬∞C.

5. Motion Sensors:

PIR sensors allow you to sense motion, almost always used to detect whether a human has moved in or out of the sensors range. They are small, inexpensive, low-power, easy to use and don‚Äôt wear out. For that reason they are commonly found in appliances and gadgets used in homes or businesses. They are often referred to as PIR, ‚ÄúPassive Infrared‚Äù, ‚ÄúPyroelectric‚Äù, or ‚ÄúIR motion‚Äù sensors.

6. Light Sensors:

A photoresistor (or light-dependent resistor, LDR, or photocell) is a light-controlled variable resistor. The resistance of a photoresistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity; in other words, it exhibits photoconductivity.

A photodiode is a semiconductor device that converts light into current. The current is generated when photons are absorbed in the photodiode. A small amount of current is also produced when no light is present. Photodiodes may contain optical filters, built-in lenses, and may have large or small surface areas.

A phototransistor is a light-sensitive transistor. A common type of phototransistor, called a photobipolar transistor, is in essence a bipolar transistor encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the base‚Äìcollector junction.

MQ ‚Äì 2 is a flammable gas and smoke sensor detects the concentrations of combustible gas in the air and outputs its reading as an analog voltage. It is used for home or factory gas leakage monitoring devices, suitable for liquefied petroleum gas, butane, propane, methane, ethanol, hydrogen, smoke and other monitoring devices.

This module is made using Alcohol Gas Sensor MQ3. It is a low cost semiconductor sensor which can detect the presence of alcohol gases at concentrations from 0.05 mg/L to 10 mg/L. The sensitive material used for this sensor is SnO2, whose conductivity is lower in clean air. It‚Äôs conductivity increases as the concentration of alcohol gases increases. It has high sensitivity to alcohol and has a good resistance to disturbances due to smoke, vapor and gasoline. This module provides both digital and analog outputs. MQ3 alcohol sensor module can be easily interfaced with Microcontrollers, Arduino Boards, Raspberry Pi etc.

This propane gas sensor detects the concentrations of LPG, isobutane, and propane in the air and ouputs its reading as an analog voltage. The sensor can measure concentrations of 300 to 10,000 ppm.The sensor can operate at temperatures from -10 to 50¬∞C and consumes less than 150 mA at 5 V.

This is a simple-to-use Carbon Monoxide (CO) sensor, suitable for sensing CO concentrations in the air. The MQ-7 can detect CO-gas concentrations anywhere from 20 to 2000ppm.

This sensor has a high sensitivity and fast response time. The sensor‚Äôs output is an analog resistance. The drive circuit is very simple; all you need to do is power the heater coil with 5V, add a load resistance, and connect the output to an ADC.

8. Distance / Proximity Sensors:

This is the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor. This economical sensor provides 2cm to 400cm of non-contact measurement functionality with a ranging accuracy that can reach up to 3mm. Each HC-SR04 module includes an ultrasonic transmitter, a receiver and a control circuit.

Infrared proximity sensor made by Sharp. Part # GP2Y0A02YK0F has an analog output that varies from 2.8V at 15cm to 0.4V at 150cm with a supply voltage between 4.5 and 5.5VDC. The sensor has a Japanese Solderless Terminal (JST) Connector. We recommend purchasing the related pigtail below or soldering wires directly to the back of the module.

9. Motion / Direction / Location Sensors:

This sensor is a carrier/breakout board for the ST L3G4200D three-axis gyroscope, which measures the angular rates of rotation about the roll (X), pitch (Y), and yaw (Z) axes. Angular velocity measurements with a configurable range of ¬±250¬∞/s, ¬±500¬∞/s, or ¬±2000¬∞/s can be read through a digital I¬≤C or SPI interface. The board operates from 2.5‚Äì5.5 V and has a 0.1‚Ä≥ pin spacing.

MPU6050 sensor module is complete 6-axis Motion Tracking Device. It combines 3-axis Gyroscope, 3-axis Accelerometer and Digital Motion Processor all in small package. Also, it has additional feature of on-chip Temperature sensor. It has I2C bus interface to communicate with the microcontrollers.

The ITG-3200 features three 16-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for digitizing the gyro outputs, a user-selectable internal low-pass filter bandwidth, and a Fast-Mode I2C (400kHz) interface. Additional features include an embedded temperature sensor and a 2% accurate internal oscillator.

HMC5883L is Honeywell‚Äôs 3-axis digital compass. Communication with the HMC5883L is simple and all done through an I2C interface. There is no on-board regulator, so a regulated voltage of 2.16-3.6VDC should be supplied.

10. Imaging Sensors:

This camera module is capable of 1080p video and still images and connects directly to your Raspberry Pi. Connect the included ribbon cable to the CSI (Camera Serial Interface) port on your Raspberry Pi, boot up the latest version of Raspbian and you are good to go.

The ov7670 is an image sensor manufactured by Omnivision. It can provide the full functionality of a single-chip VGA camera and image processor in a small footprint package. The OV7670/OV7171 provides full-frame, sub-sampled or windowed 8-bit images in a wide range of formats, controlled through the Serial Camera Control Bus (SCCB) interface.

11. Magnetic Sensors:

Reed Switch:

The reed switch is an electrical switch operated by an applied magnetic field. It was invented at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1936 by W. B. Ellwood. When the device is exposed to a magnetic field, the two ferrous materials inside the switch pull together and the switch closes. When the magnetic field is removed, the reeds separate and the switch opens.

Magnetic Switch (Magnetic Door / Window Sensor):

Magnetic Switch is a small reed switch assembly specifically designed to alert you when doors, drawers, or any other aperture opens. These types of switches are primarily used in home security systems. One half of the assembly set on a window or door frame and the other attached to the window or door itself. When the switch set is separated from each other the contact is broken and triggers an alarm.

The US1881 is a Hall-effect latch designed in mixed signal CMOS technology. The device integrates a voltage regulator, Hall sensor with dynamic offset cancellation system, Schmitt trigger and an open-drain output driver, all in a single package.

The split core type sensor, is particularly suitable for DIY projects. It can be clipped straight on to either the live or neutral wire coming into the building without having to do any high voltage electrical work. The measured current is alternative, and the sensor is calibrated to measure a max of 100A AC. 100A is the RMS value of the maximum current the sensor can handle.

IoT Actuators

An actuator is a device that converts energy into motion. It is usually used to apply a force on some thing. In our example, the actuator would apply force to switch on the motor of the water pump. Actuators can create linear, oscillatory or rotatory motion based on how they are designed.

Let‚Äôs explore some of the basic actuators you may use in your IoT projects ‚Äì

A servomotor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback. It also requires a relatively sophisticated controller, often a dedicated module designed specifically for use with servomotors.

Stepper motors are DC motors that move in discrete steps. They have multiple coils that are organized in groups called ‚Äúphases‚Äù. By energizing each phase in sequence, the motor will rotate, one step at a time.

With a computer controlled stepping you can achieve very precise positioning and/or speed control. For this reason, stepper motors are the motor of choice for many precision motion control applications.

DC (Direct Current) Motors are two wire (power & ground), continuous rotation motors. When you supply power, a DC motor will start spinning until that power is removed. Most DC motors run at a high RPM (revolutions per minute), examples being computer cooling fans, or radio controlled car wheels.

A linear actuator is an actuator that creates motion in a straight line, in contrast to the circular motion of a conventional electric motor. Linear actuators are used in machine tools and industrial machinery, in computer peripherals such as disk drives and printers, in valves and dampers, and in many other places where linear motion is required. Hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders inherently produce linear motion. Many other mechanisms are used to generate linear motion from a rotating motor.

A relay is an electrically operated switch. Many relays use an electromagnet to mechanically operate a switch, but other operating principles are also used, such as solid-state relays. Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by a separate low-power signal, or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal. The first relays were used in long distance telegraph circuits as amplifiers: they repeated the signal coming in from one circuit and re-transmitted it on another circuit. Relays were used extensively in telephone exchanges and early computers to perform logical operations.

A solenoid is simply a specially designed electromagnet. Solenoids are inexpensive, and their use is primarily limited to on-off applications such as latching, locking, and triggering. They are frequently used in home appliances (e.g. washing machine valves), office equipment (e.g. copy machines), automobiles (e.g. door latches and the starter solenoid), pinball machines (e.g., plungers and bumpers), and factory automation.

"As an ""outside observer"" (I don't live in Eugene), I'm always amazed at how effectively the City government and Eugene citizens can combine to turn every decision into a bruhaha.  Over the 45 years I've lived in the area that list of contentious decisions has steadily grown and the apparent mutual distrust steadily increased.  

To me the EWEB site seemed a ""no-brainer.""  Yet, it was rather cavalierly dismissed by the Council in favor of a new City Hall on the old site.  That decision doesn't seem to be working out very well.  

May I offer a suggestion: Put everything on hold.  Then, after the November elections and the seating of the new Council, perform an objective (OK, as objective as possible) cost/benefits analysis of these two leading possibilities.  If the Council develops or hears of any promising other choices, put them on the table as well.  

A flawed process quite frequently yields a flawed product.  I think the City of Eugene has validated this statement.",0,en,0

"Waiting On Wednesday ~ Dead Ice by Laurell K Hamilton

‚ÄúWaiting On‚Äù Wednesday is a weekly feature hosted by Breaking the Spine where we talk about the books we are looking forward to.

Anita Blake has the highest kill count of any vampire executioner in the country. She‚Äôs a U.S. Marshal who can raise zombies with the best of them. But ever since she and master vampire Jean-Claude went public with their engagement, all she is to anyone and everyone is Jean-Claude‚Äôs fianc√©e.

It‚Äôs wreaking havoc with her reputation as a hard ass‚Äîto some extent. Luckily, in professional circles, she‚Äôs still the go-to expert for zombie issues. And right now, the FBI is having one hell of a zombie issue.

Someone is producing zombie porn. Anita has seen her share of freaky undead fetishes, so this shouldn‚Äôt bother her. But the women being victimized aren‚Äôt just mindless, rotting corpses. Their souls are trapped behind their eyes, signaling voodoo of the blackest kind.

It‚Äôs the sort of case that can leave a mark on a person. And Anita‚Äôs own soul may not survive unscathed . . .

I am so behind! I need to get caught up before this releases. I only have Affliction to read, but that was released, what, like 2 years ago? Definitely not like me! This is the year to get caught up on series. Dead Ice releases on June 2, 2015. Isn‚Äôt this cover awesome?!

 As the key maintainer of Template:Inflation (ha!), and chief occasional money-over-time reviewer at FAC, I recommend using a real time comparator like Measuring Worth too.  The inflation templates are shitty CPI templates with poor data-sets and at best duplicate Measuring Worth's superior data.  At worst, using a CPI inflation is wildly inappropriate.  While there are partial alphas for non-CPI inflations (ha) they too suffer from dodgy wikipedia template syndrome.  Remember to cite measuring worth!

"Samson Mow is chief strategy officer at Blockstream.

This exclusive opinion piece is part of CoinDesk‚Äôs ‚ÄúBitcoin at 10: The Satoshi White Paper‚Äù series.

It‚Äôs been 10 years since Bitcoin‚Äôs white paper was released, and the world has had 10 years to understand the profound impact of Bitcoin. We‚Äôve also had 10 years of development to improve usability and scaling.

Yet despite all this time to evolve our understanding, we somehow have had the emergence of zealots that attempt to interpret the Bitcoin white paper as if it were scripture.

The Bitcoin white paper is not a bible, it wasn‚Äôt even meant to be definitive.

Case in point, Bitcoin‚Äôs white paper was released in October 2008, just a few months before the source code for version 0.1 was made publicly available. But, the software itself had already been in development for a year and a half and contained features and important consensus rules that were not mentioned at all in the white paper.

‚ÄúThe functional details are not covered in the paper, but the sourcecode is coming soon,‚Äù ‚Äì Satoshi Nakamoto, November 2008.

The white paper was intended as an introductory text for the cypherpunk community. Satoshi went as far as to say he was ‚Äúbetter with code than words‚Äù in an email to Hal Finney shortly after the white paper‚Äôs release.

This will prove obvious to those who know the code, as there are quite a few things not mentioned in the white paper, and it even included some claims that were incorrect.

21 million coin cap. Although a ‚Äòpredetermined number‚Äô is referred to, Satoshi only provided the schedule and cap when he announced the release of the code.

Although a ‚Äòpredetermined number‚Äô is referred to, Satoshi only provided the schedule and cap when he announced the release of the code. Longest chain. The chain representing the majority-accepted transaction history is frequently referred to as the ‚Äúlongest chain,‚Äù when today we know that this is not the case. The change from ‚ÄòHeight‚Äô to ‚ÄòChainWork‚Äô was authored by Satoshi in July 2010. The white paper itself was not updated.

The change from ‚ÄòHeight‚Äô to ‚ÄòChainWork‚Äô was authored by Satoshi in July 2010. The white paper itself was not updated. ASIC mining. CPU mining is mentioned throughout the paper. Satoshi later stated that ‚Äúcompute clusters will eventually hog all the generated coins‚Äù and that he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwant to hasten that day.‚Äù Looking back, it‚Äôs inevitable that a successful Bitcoin would result in CPU mining becoming irrelevant.

Difficulty algorithm. As outlined in the white paper, this would have used a moving average and not the set 2016 block periods implemented in the code, seriously altering the incentives to resist change.

Bitcoin script or smart-contract system. Satoshi would later suggest that Bitcoin scripts could be used for ‚Äúescrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature,‚Äù but script capability was not mentioned at all in the white paper.

Text in the Wind

But if the white paper quickly fell out of date, Satoshi didn‚Äôt seem to notice.

He didn‚Äôt even bother to correct the white paper to make it more accurately reflect the code he released. I imagine that his focus was very much on the live network‚Äôs code base and not a paper that was already becoming irrelevant.

This is important to note as despite changes that altered the design of the live network substantially, the white paper has become a pseudo-religious text for some who seemed to view the subsequent open-source evolution of the code as tantamount to sacrilege. This still baffles me.

Of course, Satoshi continued to comment on and commit code to Bitcoin long after its initial release. This was a period where Satoshi was finally able to discuss with others how the system might evolve over time. His ideas were not always perfectly thought out and he didn‚Äôt present himself as being infallible, yet he continued to have flairs of ingenuity.

One idea, which eventually caught the imagination of others, was payment channels or ‚Äúhigh frequency trades‚Äù as he called them. This allowed users to repeatedly update the state of an unconfirmed transaction prior to it being broadcast and leveraged some of the features present in Bitcoin‚Äôs code, which (*gasp*) weren‚Äôt mentioned in the white paper.

This particular ‚Äúpost-white paper‚Äù idea, along with Dr. Christian Decker‚Äôs ‚ÄúDuplex Micropayment Channels‚Äù paper, formed the basis of today‚Äôs Lightning Network. As other developers took the concept, addressed security issues, and extended it, we now have created a rapid, peer-to-peer Bitcoin micropayments network.

The point I‚Äôm making with these examples of white paper omissions and differences to the implementation itself is that while software evolves, read-only text documents do not. The white paper was an attempt at a high-level introduction by someone who had already put far more time and care into writing the code itself.

It omitted many details that have been key to Bitcoin‚Äôs success so far, and yet some people have tried elevating it to the position of holy scripture in misguided attempts to force minority design decisions.

Evolution in Progress

All this goes to show that the software itself defines what Bitcoin is and that it‚Äôs been shaped by the collective vision of the majority over the years to programmatically express what rules they want to see enforced on the network.

The written word is open to personal interpretation. The execution of code isn‚Äôt, and for the rules encoded in a consensus critical system, the code is all that matters.

When he published Bitcoin‚Äôs source code, I think Satoshi knew that he was handing over a creation of great social value to the public, but I don‚Äôt think he could have imagined how far it would come in just 10 years.

Putting the price and other distractions aside, the amount of human effort being poured into Bitcoin‚Äôs infrastructure today is something that encourages me, especially as so much work is carried out by volunteers. Just consider that the latest major release (0.17) contains over 700 pull requests and 135 developers contributed to it.

Sync times are improving even though the blockchain continues to grow; we can still sync the entire Bitcoin blockchain from genesis block to chain tip in under two-and-a-half hours. Ethereum, not so much.

We have new technologies like G‚ÄôRoot, Bulletproofs, Confidential Transactions, Confidential Assets, PSBT, and Signature Aggregation (Schnorr) for the base layer, while the Lightning Network allows developers to experiment permissionlessly without needing consensus changes to the base protocol.

With the launch of the Liquid Network, we‚Äôre starting to realize the promise of sidechains with the first real solution to improving inter-exchange settlement. All of these developments will allow innovation in the Bitcoin space to accelerate at an unprecedented pace.

A New Course

There‚Äôs no question that Satoshi did everyone a great service when he released the Bitcoin source code. He used economic and social incentives to solve a problem computer scientists had been working on for years.

Perhaps an equal stroke of genius was his decision to leave the project.

By removing himself as a single point of failure and definitively handing over control of the protocol to everyone else, he let the world have a say in its evolution through the majority consensus mechanism his code incentivized.

‚ÄúNever ask what I would do. Just do what‚Äôs right.‚Äù ‚Äì Steve Jobs

Before Steve Jobs passed, he left these words of advice to Tim Cook. It makes sense because it wouldn‚Äôt be productive or effective for Apple employees to spend their time guessing what Jobs would have wanted.

The future is always changing and past wisdom alone cannot serve as a crutch for making the correct decisions to move forward.

I‚Äôm sure Satoshi also wouldn‚Äôt have wanted people to try and divine the future from his white paper, especially since the Bitcoin codebase has been extensively amended by both himself and others. You certainly can‚Äôt hold up a piece of 10-year-old text and expect it to have any authority over a decentralized network of individuals making personal choices.

Let the code speak for itself.

"Severity of drug dependence, economic pressure and HIV-related risk behaviors among non-institutionalized female injecting drug users who are also sex workers in China.
Female injecting drug users (IDUs) who are also sex workers (FSW-IDUs) is an important bridge population transmitting HIV from the IDU population to clients of FSWs. Little is known about the relationships between severity of drug dependence, economic pressure and relevant HIV-related risk behaviors. 281 non-institutionalized participants were recruited using snowball sampling methods. Anonymous face-to-face interviews were administered by trained doctors. 64.1% of participants used condoms inconsistently with their clients in the past 6 months; 28.5% served at least 2 clients per day and 48.4% practiced at least one of the three studied needle sharing behaviors. Severity of drug dependence (adjusted OR=1.05, p<0.01) and economic pressure (adjusted OR=1.07 to 2.52, p<0.05) were significantly associated with inconsistent condom use with clients in the last 6 months. Severity of drug dependence (adjusted OR=1.15, p<0.01) and variables related to perceived economic pressure (adjusted OR=1.09-3.05, p<0.05) were significantly associated with higher frequency of commercial sex transaction. Severity of drug dependence (adjusted OR=1.07, p<0.01) were also associated with needle sharing behaviors. In summary models, severity of drug dependence (OR=1.17, p<0.001), economic pressure (OR=1.39, p<0.001) and their interaction term (OR=0.98, p<0.001) were all associated with inconsistent condom use with clients in the last 6 months. Prevalence of unprotected commercial sex was high and was independently associated with severity of drug dependence and economic pressure; severity of drug dependence was also associated with needle sharing behaviors. Such issues need to be fully considered when planning research studies and interventions.",0,en,0

"A microwave filter is a two-port network used to control the frequency response at a certain point in a microwave system by providing transmission at frequencies within the passband of the filter, and attenuation in the stopband of the filter. Typical frequency responses include low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, and band-reject characteristics.
Multi-cavity resonator microwave filters are used in communication satellites, particularly those launched into geosynchronous orbit for communications with ground stations. A plurality of filters are used in a typical satellite, each filter able to separate and isolate a specific signal or frequency bandwidth from all of the signals and frequencies transmitted to the satellite. After separation, each signal is amplified to strengthen the signal, whereafter, the amplified signals are transmitted back to ground stations. A single satellite may be equipped with twenty to sixty filters, depending on its mission.
Cavity resonator filters are hollow structures sized to resonate at specific frequency bandwidths in response to microwave signals communicated to the filter structures. The filter resonates using a specific mode dependent upon the geometry of the cavity. Filters which resonate using one mode only are referred to as single mode filters. Dielectric resonators have been introduced into cavity resonator structures, in part to improve output response and reduce the size of the cavity. Cavities with dielectric resonators are often referred to in the art as ""loaded"" cavities.
One such cavity filter is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,220,300 issued to Snyder wherein a series of linearly arranged cavities are each loaded with a dielectric resonator. The wall formed between each pair of adjacent cavities is provided with a sized iris (or opening). Each iris provides a means for coupling magnetic energy between adjacent resonators. Further, a tuning screw partially extends into each iris for tuning the iris coupling.
There have also been numerous attempts at building dual mode filters, where either a cavity structure or a loaded cavity structure is designed to resonate using two modes or ""dual modes"". One such filter is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,697,898 issued to Blachier et al. The disclosed filter includes an elongated cylinder having planar walls therein to define a plurality of cylindrical cavities. Each cavity is coupled to adjacent cavities via a specifically sized iris formed in the wall therebetween. Dual mode cavity structures have several drawbacks.
For instance, in a communications satellite, a typical desired output from a microwave filter includes a high degree of linearity for the amplitude of the passband frequency range (the desired output) and linearity for the group delay response, in order to minimize distortion in the signal passing through the filter, while maintaining high rejection slopes flanking the filter passband. All dual or single mode filters typically require external equalization to achieve the desired performance. External equalization necessitates the use of ferrite coupling circulators, thus incurring the mass and volume penalty associated with such devices.
Dual mode filters typically require one tuning screw for each resonator to properly tune the modes and one more screw for each interresonator coupling. As readily seen, a fair amount of time is required for proper tuning of each filter in order to get the desired frequency bandwidth output. In general, dual mode filters are less amenable to transfer function control and flexibility. Lower control of the electrical characteristics means more meticulous tuning is required to make the filter meet performance requirements.
It is well known that general transfer function characteristics can be realized by a filter arranged in the canonical form structure of coupled cavity resonators as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,477,785 issued to Atia. General transfer functions include the elliptic function response for bandpass characteristics and functions having finite transmission zeros.
For an even number of cavities, this canonical form is symmetrical and consists of two identical ""halves"". Each of the two halves consists of n direct coupled cavities having ""series"" couplings of the same sign. Each cavity in one half is coupled to a corresponding cavity in the other half by ""shunt"" couplings of arbitrary sign. Illustrated in FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of the canonical form of a 2n resonator filter. The series couplings M.sub.12, M.sub.23, . . . M.sub.n,n+1 all have the same sign (positive) while the shunt couplings M.sub.12n, M.sub.2,2n-1, M.sub.n-1,n+2 must be either positive or negative for arbitrary transfer function realization.
In the canonical configuration, the electrical response characteristics of the filter are governed by almost every cavity. Thus, tuning the filter to achieve a desired response is not immediately obvious. What is needed is a filter having predetermined response characteristics dependent upon substructures or subfilters having preset response characteristics.",0,en,0

Oh, wait. That‚Äôs not quite the ‚Äújasmine‚Äù that Bovetti is attempting to replicate in this chocolate, is it?

That‚Äôs a bit of a shame, really. I‚Äôd much rather find Disney-themed chocolates in my local store than, say, chocolate imprinted with Twilight devil-spawn*.

But I digress. This is my fifth and final Bovetti chocolate review (for the foreseeable future), so read on to discover whether this French chocolate company went out with a bang or a whimper‚Ä¶

Bovetti Dark Chocolate with Jasmine Flowers

As soon as I removed this chocolate from its cardboard packaging, my speedy typing fingers wrote down ‚Äúoooh, smells good! The aroma is very fragrant.‚Äù

And then I felt like an idiot. ‚ÄúThe aroma is fragrant‚Äù? That simply means that the aroma is an aroma. Clearly, my Pulitzer Prize shall continue to elude me‚Ä¶

Luckily for all of us, I soon picked out brown sugar and floral notes in the aroma of this chocolate. It wasn‚Äôt quite like closing my eyes and burying my nose in a bunch of my grandfather‚Äôs gorgeously perfumed home-grown roses, but then again, how could it be? Bovetti is chocolate, not roses. (See what I mean? Pulitzer!)

After such stellar note-taking as detailed above, I took a nibble of this 73% dark chocolate and was suddenly, immediately, tautologically delighted with its earthy and muscovado sugar flavours.

Many of you would know by now that my chocolate tastes tend away from the red fruit spectrum. Subsequently, I was inordinately pleased with the notes that sang out to me from this Bovetti chocolate. I picked out clotted cream, dusky cocoa, rich hot fudge sauce (the proper kind; not chocolate syrup from a bottle), marscapone, charcoal, sawdust, and walnuts.

If you who don‚Äôt regularly crave chocolate that tastes of sawdust and walnuts, you‚Äôre missing out. Ahem.

While this chocolate isn‚Äôt astringent or bitter, it also isn‚Äôt overly sweet. As a result, the sugared jasmine flowers sprinkled on top provide not only a textural contrast but a pleasing burst of floral sweetness. One thing I‚Äôm always wary of when it comes to floral flavours is their tendency to taste like soap. Thankfully, the sugared jasmine used in this chocolate is subtle enough to remind me more of perfume than detergent.

And that, my friends, is a flavour of chocolate I can wholeheartedly recommend.

* Any Twilight lovers out there, I shall hereby disclose that I‚Äôve read all four books, and am quite intrigued by how, in the name of all things decent, the birth scene of Breaking Dawn is going to be filmed.

*laughs* Ellie, I‚Äôm really, really not joking. I did the exact same thing back in 2008 too üòõ Actually, the bulk of the good stuff *was* from America. Don‚Äôt underestimate your country‚Äôs chocolate making capabilities! üòâ

Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Tell you all about it when I got the time!

As for Twilight, I think it is best not to think about the birth scene. There are several other bits in that last book I would prefer not to think about too‚Ä¶

Oh, was this post about chocolate? I didn‚Äôt notice! I was just singing Aladdin songs in my head the whole way through reading (until the end when I noticed you were clearly having the same concerns I have).

I thought the flowers were bloom from the heat at first and was concerned at how it would taste so was relieved it was actually ok! And glad the floral worked ‚Äì I often think of floral scented things from my childhood (erasers, pens, dolls) smelled like a cheap air freshener.

Christine, sadly, I have to disagree with you! I‚Äôve read the books, and while the first one was fun in a trashy way, I found the rest quite boring and‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôll keep my other comments to myself as I completely appreciate that everyone has different tastes üòõ In fact, I‚Äôm a fan of anyone reading anything at all, so more power to you!

Whee, it seems like many people are in a Disney fever these days! üòÄ Aladdin is one of my favorites, and I love the song ‚ÄúArabian Nights‚Äù at the beginning of the movie. So cool! üôÇ

I really like Twilight, although I think it‚Äôs not a love story, but a story about a pathological depency disorder. üòâ Still, a very nice read! And I love the movies, they‚Äôre so beautifully filmed, and the music is cool! üòÄ

I think that scene will be an eyes shut sequence for me. When I read that part in the book, I got really sick. I cannot see or imagine other people in such pain, it‚Äôs like feeling it in my own body.

As you can see in my reply to Ellie, when I went traveling around America and Europe this time last year, I returned home with over $200 worth of chocolate. So some of it is from that, and then I‚Äôve also been lucky enough to receive several packages of chocolates from bloggers/friends across the world in recent months üôÇ

I‚Äôve just gotta say ‚Äúhell yes!‚Äù about the Aladdin shoutout, first of all.

And I had to read the first Twilight book for a class, so naturally I read all of the others too. I find Stephenie Meyer to be a horrible writer, for the most part, but I did like the books okay. I agree that the birth scene‚Ä¶will be hilarious.

ARGH‚Ä¶. I am sooooo obsessed with Twilight, Im a Twi-hard! üôÇ I‚Äôve read the books (a number of times) listened to them, (a number of times) had to get the audio for when I couldn‚Äôt sleep, and sadly, I‚Äôve contributed a huge chunk of moula to collecting Twilight bits and pieces‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt actually think I‚Äôve put any thought into how they will do the birth scene? Gross! ;(

Anna, you are now officially in the running for the most Twilight-obsessed person I know, along with a girl who has gone to Sydney for the second and third movie premieres. If only I‚Äôd known this earlier, I could‚Äôve bought you the Bella and Jacob Barbies I saw in Europe üòâ

We did an Aladdin performance for our school assembly in Year 6, and I wanted to be Jasmine but some other girl got chosen instead. I think I did a good job at being a generic background girl, but it took a little while to get over my disappointment. I wish I had some of this chocolate back then to assist me in this.

I‚Äôll never be able to think of/sing that song again without having your gorgeous visage in my mind‚Äôs eye üòâ

Oh, I completely understand the second-fiddle starlet thing. In kidnergarten, I was a generic angel in the Nativity Play whilst my best friend was Mary. I got back at her in Year 6, though, when I wrote and starred in a musical about rubbish and recycling.

jQuery Validation plugin with JQGrid?

Has anyone successfully used the jQuery Validation plugin with JQGrid? I realize that JQGrid has its own validation scheme, but it's limited and a little clumsy; and I'd prefer to reuse the validation UI, language, and rules that I'm using with the rest of my forms.

A:

Edit inline and Validations is possibile with this steps.
Write your function to highlight and unhilight your input box:
GridErrorHighlight = function(el, er, ev) {
    $(el)
        .addClass('ui-state-error')
    .parent()
        .addClass('ui-state-error');
}

GridErrorUnHighlight = function(el, er, ev) {
    $(el)
        .removeClass('ui-state-error')
    .parent()
       .removeClass('ui-state-error');
}

Extend jqgrid:
; (function($) {
    $.jgrid.extend({
        onErrorHighlight: GridErrorHighlight,
        onUnHighlight: GridErrorUnHighlight,
    });
})(jQuery);

Now is easy for jQuery validation plugin use your custom functions. Is only necessary to create this options and initialize validation plugin:
var table = $('#tableid').jqGrid({});

var validateOpt = {
        meta: ""validate"",
        highlight: table.onErrorHighlight,
        unhighlight: table.onUnHighlight
    };

$(document).ready(function() {
    $('#formId').validate(val);
});

Now is easy to set validator for single input cell.
We use jqGrid EditOptions into Model to add custom class for validation:
""editoptions"":{""class"":"" {validate: { range:[0,1] } }""}

that's all!

"Implications of human tissue studies for radiation protection.
Through radiochemical analysis of voluntary tissue donations, the U.S. Transuranium and Uranium Registries (USTR) are gaining improved understanding of the distribution and biokinetics of actinide elements in occupationally exposed persons. Evaluation of the first two whole-body contributions to the USTR revealed an inverse proportionality between actinide concentration and bone ash. The analysis of a whole body with significant 241Am deposition indicated a significantly shorter half-time in liver and a greater fraction resident in the skeleton than predicted by existing models. Other studies with tissues obtained at autopsy suggest that existing biokinetic models for 238Pu and 241Am and the currently accepted models and limits on intake, which use these models as their basis, may be inaccurately implying that revisions of existing safety standards may be necessary. Other studies of the registries are designed to evaluate in-vivo estimates of actinide deposition with those derived from postmortem tissue analysis, to compare results of animal experiments with human data, and to review histopathologic slides for tissue changes that might be attributable to exposure to transuranic elements. The implications of these recent findings and other work of the registries is discussed from the standpoint of this potential effect on biokinetic modeling, internal dose assessment, and safety standards and operational health physics practices.",0,en,0

 Ncmvocalist's questions 

Hello Rootology. You've made a series of comments at the block review (for the block imposed on Ikip), and you later reversed Ikip's block. I would request that you answer my questions as promptly as possible. 

 Have you made any attempts to communicate with the blocking admin prior to your unblock? If so, how many minutes elapsed between your attempts to communicate with the blocking admin, and your unblock?
 You have stated to AMIB: """"You as an admin have zero standing or authority to levy this block as one of the deepest """"deletionist"""" partisans on this site, just as anyone deeply involved in the squadron would have zero standing or authority to undo it."""" Can you please provide diffs to support this claim?
 In saying to AMIB: """"You must undo this block and not do such a thing again, or you will not be long for your tools once the Arbitration Committee sees what you're about"""", can you clarify what you meant?
 You've stated to AMIB: """"You pretty much missed the goal as far right as you can on this one, for being involved."""" Can you provide diffs for this claim? 

Thanks.   

Hi. Blocks and admin actions are never sacrosanct, unless they are from the Arbitration Committee as a body or cited as an OFFICE action. Any can be reversed once by any admin in good faith with justification. I provided my justifications here. For your specific questions:
 We were talking in the ANI thread. That is classically regarded as sufficient, but I posted the diffs that he was going to pull for him. There's no canvassing for days before the block. Since blocks are preventative by policy and not punative, the block automatically has no standing. I re-opened the archived discussion, that Abd closed, so that my unblock can be reviewed and re-instated by any uninvolved admin if required.
 This would take a long while to gather it all, but a long-standing user's leanings are hardly secret. I'm a BLP zealot most times; Ikip is an inclusionist; DGG is an inclusionist; JoshuaZ is an inclusionist; AMiB is a deletionist; Phil Sandifer is an inclusionist. 
 Admins have repeatedly been told by the AC (and policy) that they may not use tools in areas in which they are involved. My strongly-worded suggestion was so that another good admin doesn't fall down that hole.
 See #3. Again, any demonstratably uninvolved admin can freely reverse my unblock, I waive all wheel warriness, etc.

AMIB has replied to my unblock, by the way, on that thread.  (C)(T) 

Okay; just to note that it was very appropriate of you to revert the closing and leave the thread open, for the reasons you've stated. 

There are a couple of things I'd like to clarify for future incidents. If AMIB had participated in that particular deletion discussion, then using his tools would likely be inappropriate. Alternatively (as may be the case here), if AMIB had been involved in personal and direct conflict with Ikip, especially if it was recent, then his use of tools would not be appropriate. Such involvement can cloud judgement. However, mere general participation in other deletion debates/discussions is not necessarily enough for an admin to be considered """"involved"""".

"There's a simple test to determine if what you write is true:

Does NCR critique the salaries and finances of other Catholic orgs?

NCR indeed does that, as we can see with its recent crusade on the finances of the K of C.   

Therefore there's no grounds to make a moral appeal that it's somehow wrong for us to ask what NCR is paying its employees.

As for my salary, it isn't tied to donations, nor is it tied to appeals tied to religious belief.  However, the employees at NCR receive income that is directly tied to appeals for donations, and also directly tied to Catholicism.

In my view, this means that NCR is beholden to be straight with its readership and tell them how much it is paying its employees.

Maybe some of these employees are being paid jack, and others are being paid huge six figure salaries.

Is there some technical reason or is this just sour apples from ALSA in revenge for no docs for so very long?

I think because the demand isn't that great for it. With the recent fiasco's that creative has pulled off, the priority for support on the X-Fi I would imagine is pretty low. There is however greater demand for SoC audio support and for alternative chipsets such as the popular Cmedia 8788 and Asus chipsets (rebranded Cmedia).

Comment

Unfortunately, the audio situation on Linux is awful. ALSA is a bunch of crap, the driver quality varies extremely and the new layers and layers on top of it, like pulseaudio, don't make it any better. It's quite ridiculous that it's still hit-and-miss when you want to play multiple audio streams at the same time.

Comment

No demand for X-Fi support? Maybe people are just sick and tired of waiting and lack of any response. Many people have also moved onto different soundcards as a result.

James Courtier-Dutton doesn't care and just brushes everyone off the moment they even mention the word ""X-Fi"". He is the one with the datasheet, and since this datasheet is under NDA, he's the only one that apparently can code this driver.

I can tell you there is (or was) more demand for X-Fi support than stupid System on a chip support that nobody, you or me, will care about probably ever. As you can see I am rather disappointed by the lack of support, waited for years, and now since moved to an external DAC, and there are many people like me who no longer really care about support anymore as its been too long already and have bought something else. Sure hardware mixing and resampling would be great, but at this point its easier to just stick with an Audigy 4 for that. Its like waiting for UT3, there are few that actually give a crap anymore as most have just moved onto other things, as well as decline in popularity of the game as a whole.

So ALSA has the specs, and they don't really care about coding the driver in a timely fashion at this point in time it seems. Nobody bothered porting the OSS code over to ALSA as the driver is a piece of crap, no hardware mixing, no resampling, etc. ALSA is also crap as anyone thats never coded for ALSA before wont ever dare even as much touch the code as its a complete nightmare to develop for. Not to mention ALSA completely goes against the openness and portability of open source as its only for Linux.

Lack of proper sound support is one of the major downfalls of Linux as a whole. Sure many cards are supported, but try naming a single card that has *complete* support that was made in this decade, I dare ya.

Comment

What sound chip do the SoCs use? Something derived from an old chip which they already have working drivers for?

SoC is getting more popular amongst the geekier crowds, and is probably worth a lot more for Linux longterm as it is Linux on SoC is a good choice for thin client set-ups, light-weight desktop set-ups, basically any set-up that isn't trying to do heavy computing which is everything except the workstations and game boxes.

"My current thinking is that I'll leave Bernier off the ballot altogether.  While I personally agree with many/most of his policies, I think he'll have a hard time selling them to the general voting public that may not be ready for, or receptive to, some fairly dramatic changes in the way the country is governed.  Coyne wrote a good piece in the NP about Bernier's pros and cons, including his tendency to ""oversell"" some of his policies which may scare off some voters who could otherwise be in favour of them.  Because of that, I don't think he has much of a chance against Trudeau in 2019.  

I'll probably leave off Scheer as well, as I've just never been all that impressed with him and social conservatism won't be a winning strategy in 2019.

It's become a far-right ethno-identity politics party like those found in Europe, driven by a personality cult. This is as far from true conservatism as one can get. Conservatives can debate policies because they are driven by ideas. Far-right politics is devoid of policies because it is driven by reactionary impulses and contempt for ideas. Too often under Obama the tendency has been to make things up as they went along, but at least there was regard for basic rules of civility. For the next four years we won't even have that to guide us. It's going to be rough ride.

"Photographer Terry Richardson and then-Senator Barack Obama (D-Ill.)

WARNING: Some of the images and language in this story are sexually graphic and disturbing.

(CNSNews.com) -- On June 20, 2007, then-Sen. Barack Obama (D.-Ill.), who was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination at the time, hosted a ‚Äúportrait session‚Äù in his U.S. Senate office where he posed for and with Terry Richardson, a man already well-known, as the flyleaf of a coffee-table collection of his work put it, as the photographer who ‚Äútook 1970s porn esthetic and made it fashion chic.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho uses his fashion money to fund an X-rated website? Yes, Richardson,‚Äù said the flyleaf to the 2004 book Terryworld, published by Taschen Books.

‚ÄúAnd who can‚Äôt resist getting his clothes off and jumping in front of his own lens? Well, that would be Terry Richardson as well,‚Äù said the flyleaf. ‚ÄúWelcome to ‚ÄòTerryworld,‚Äô the land restraint forgot. Porn stars, super models, transsexuals, hillbillies, friends, pets and celebrities all do for his lens what they‚Äôll do for no other. And if any of them later wonder why they did it, just blame it on ‚ÄòTerryworld,‚Äô where taboos are null and void, and fashion finds sex a perfect fit.‚Äù

Terry Richardson with a sheep. (Photo in 2004 book, ""Terryworld."")

The book itself includes photos of oral sex; a nude model wearing a ‚Äúslut‚Äù crown riding a bike; a young man appearing to hang by a belt from a door; models urinating in the snow; a young woman with a large gold ball stuffed into her vagina; naked models with bags over their heads or their eyes darkened; a man with a toothbrush in his rectum; and Richardson with his teeth on a tampon string while it is inside a model‚Äôs vagina.

It also includes a photo of an apparently naked Richardson engaging in some kind of physical contact with a sheep.

Olivier Zahm, the Parisian editor of Purple magazine, says in the book, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be honest. Terry‚Äôs pictures are definitely not feminist. They are as politically ‚Äòincorrect‚Äô as pictures get. He is not glamorizing women‚Äôs power, beauty or strength. He is more portraying female beauty from a male perspective.‚Äù

In the book‚Äôs introduction, written by Dian Hanson, Richardson is quoted as saying, ‚ÄúPeople in fashion were saying, ‚ÄòIf I see one more picture of a girl with her legs spread‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs a misogynist, he‚Äôs a porn guy.‚Äô So hey, I‚Äôll spread my legs too. I‚Äôll be the object. The thought of people masturbating to me, or to pictures I take, is great. That‚Äôs a wonderful inspiration to give someone.‚Äù

Photos of women performing oral sex on men in Terry Richardson's 2004 book ""Terryworld.""

Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúportrait session‚Äù with Richardson in the Hart Senate Office Building was set up for Vibe magazine, which ran some of Richardson‚Äôs photos of Obama along with the cover article for its September 2007 issue. One of these photos showed Richardson and Obama shaking hands, smiling‚Äîand each giving a thumbs-up sign to the camera, which Richardson regularly does with his models. (Richardson later posted that same photo on his own website after Obama was reelected in November 2012.)

Writer Jeff Chang, who authored the September 2007 Vibe cover story, interviewed Obama at his Senate office on May 23, 2007, but the photo shoot did not take place then.

In an August 8, 2007 interview with National Public Radio, Vibe editor Danyel Smith described how elated she was when the magazine was able to follow-up on Chang‚Äôs interview by scheduling Terry Richardson‚Äôs photo session with Obama at Obama‚Äôs Senate office.

A young, nude woman as photographed and published in the 2004 book, ""Terryworld.""

Smith explained that the magazine‚Äôs desire to feature Obama was part of its ‚Äúcoverage of what we call leadership issues in the country.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd so we just started thinking, what about Obama?‚Äù Smith told NPR. ‚ÄúWhat does he mean to our readership? And we just said we were going to go for it. We didn't know if we could get it, if he'd be interested in it. But it was when we got the interview we were really excited. But when we got the portrait session, that's when we were pretty much jumping up and down. And it's been a fantastic experience.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, the pictures are kind of spicy,‚Äù said NPR‚Äôs Michel Martin. ‚ÄúBut what was it about the photos that took it over the top for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were in the senator's offices down in Washington, D.C., and we were trying to get him to loosen up,‚Äù said Smith.

‚ÄúBut, yeah, it was just great,‚Äù Smith continued. ‚ÄúTerry Richardson, who shot the photos, and Robin Forest, our photo editor, they got him to look at his watch. This is something that we wanted to do. There‚Äôs a thing in hip-hop music where, you know, is it time? It‚Äôs time. Looking at my Gucci, it‚Äôs about that time. What time is it? There‚Äôs always a sort of cool thing related to the sort of looking at your watch like you have somewhere to go. And since one of his campaign slogans is it's Obama‚Äôs time--his supporters tend to hold those placards up--we just wanted that headline.‚Äù

Robin Harmon, who was credited by Vibe as the groomer for the Obama-Richardson photo shoot, confirmed to CNSNews.com that it took place in Obama‚Äôs Senate offices.

Senator Barack Obama (D-Ill.), photographed by Terry Richardson, for the September 2007 cover of Vibe magazine, seven months after he had entered the race to run for president.

Vibe‚Äôs September 2007 issue used six of the photos Richardson took of Obama that day. The magazine had two versions with different covers. One cover featured Obama with his tie loosened and his jacket off, looking at his watch. The other featured a more serious Obama, with his tie tightened and his jacket on.

The table-of-contents page featured a photo of Obama rolling up his left sleeve; another page featured a photo of Obama and Richardson together, smiling, shaking hands and holding their thumbs up.The article itself included a close-up of Obama‚Äôs face and a photo of Obama smiling and with his hands in his pockets.

The headline for the article was: ‚ÄúLadies and Gentlemen, (Is This) the Next President of the United States (?).‚Äù It also included the sub-head: ‚ÄúPhotographed by Terry Richardson on June 20, 2007 in Washington, D.C.‚Äù

Did Obama, his Senate staff, or his campaign staff know about Richardson‚Äôs reputation as the man who took the ‚Äúporn esthetic and made it fashion chic‚Äù when Obama invited him into his office for the June 20, 2007 photo shoot?

A quick Lexis-Nexis search at the time would have turned up multiple items warning of the graphic nature of Richardson‚Äôs work.

For example, a week before Richardson showed up at the Hart Senate Office Building to do his portrait session with Obama, Penthouse magazine put out a press release announcing that its July issue would have a ‚Äúredesigned centerfold‚Äù that featured a perforation, making it easier to rip out of the magazine.

‚ÄúOur readers don't necessarily want to cut to the chase,‚Äù said this June 13 announcement from Penthouse. ‚ÄúThis new perforated centerfold is a great and natural addition to the magazine and we are honored that the debut centerfold was photographed by one of today's best photographers, Terry Richardson.‚Äù

Photographer Terry Richardson and then-Senator Barack Obama in (D-Ill.) in 2007.

The Sept. 10, 2006 edition of the Sunday Mail (South Australia) reported, ‚ÄúA new national advertising campaign portraying childlike young women in sexually explicit poses has outraged childhood and family groups. The Lee Jeans advertisements suggest prostitution, pornography and oral sex and the models involved, although aged in their 20s, appear to be much younger. Australian Childhood Foundation chief executive officer Dr. Joe Tucci said the pictures were a ‚Äòhorrific‚Äô representation of young people in sexually explicit poses. He called on the Advertising Standards Bureau to ban the billboard and magazine advertisements, shot by American photographer Terry Richardson.‚Äù

The July 15, 2006, Sydney Morning Herald reported, ‚ÄúIf you subscribe to the theory that sex sells in advertising, Terry Richardson is definitely your man. Best known for louche imagery that blurs the lines between photography and pornography, the 41-year-old American coaxes models into his studio to strike poses that no doubt shock their parents.‚Äù

When the Terryworld book was published in 2004, Richardson also had an art exhibit entitled ‚ÄúTerrywood‚Äù in New York City. The Observer magazine ran a cover story on the exhibit on Oct. 17, 2004. The headline: ‚ÄúGood Clean Fun? He's the former junkie punk who put the filth into fashion. Now, alongside his X-rated ad campaigns and sleazy shoots for glossy magazines, photographer Terry Richardson wants his art to be taken seriously.‚Äù

‚ÄúHis name is Terry Richardson, and the whole show consists of self-made images of Terry thrusting, rucking, prodding, pumping and, sometimes, grinning at the camera like a nerd let loose in porno heaven,‚Äù said the article. ‚Äú‚ÄòTerryworld‚Äô is a strange and contradictory place where art and fashion and pornography converge, and where, for the time being at least, pornography is the dominant aesthetic.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe girls who now come knocking on the door of Terry Richardson's studio to take part in what he calls his 'spontaneous sex acts' may be young or impressionable, exhibitionist or insecure, or all of the above, but they are all too eager and willing to perform for his camera,‚Äù says the article.

So, did Obama or his staff know about this?

Jeff Chang wrote in the September 2007 Vibe article that when he interviewed Obama in his Senate office on May 23‚Äîa month before the Terry Richardson photo shoot‚Äîhe dealt with Obama‚Äôs then-press secretary Ben LaBolt.

‚ÄúBehind closed doors, aides are working feverishly on a major lobbying-/ethics-reform bill the senator has sponsored,‚Äù wrote Chang. ‚ÄúBen LaBolt, Obama‚Äôs press secretary, says, sighing, ‚ÄòThese are the days my coffeepot is full all day.‚Äô‚Äù

At the time of the June 20, 2007 Richardson photo shoot, LaBolt was still Obama‚Äôs senatorial press secretary, but later that year would become a spokesman for Obama‚Äôs presidential campaign. LaBolt now works at The Incite Agency with former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs.

CNSNews.com contacted LaBolt by voicemail and e-mail and asked him if then-Sen. Obama‚Äôs presidential campaign or Senate staff was familiar with Terry Richardson‚Äôs reputation for ‚Äúporn esthetic‚Äù photography before the 2007 ‚Äúportrait session‚Äù in Obama‚Äôs Senate office. CNSNews.com also asked if LaBolt believes Richardon‚Äôs photography degrades women, and whether he believes, given the way Richardson presents women, Obama should express regret for having given credibility to Richardson by posing with him. LaBolt did not respond.

CNSNews.com put the same questions via e-mail to David Axelrod, who was Obama‚Äôs chief presidential campaign strategist at the time of the Richardson photo shoot. Tim Skoczek at Axelrod Strategies emailed a response on Axelrod‚Äôs behalf. Skoczek said, ‚ÄúI appreciate your reaching out and giving David the opportunity to speak for your piece, but he has no comment.‚Äù

CNSNews.com also sent the following questions to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney:

1) Was then-Sen. Obama‚Äôs presidential campaign or Senate staff familiar with Terry Richardson reputation for ‚Äúporn chic‚Äù photography before they scheduled Obama‚Äôs 2007 ‚Äúportrait session‚Äù with Richardson? If not, why not?

2) Does President Obama regret that the campaign let that ‚Äúportrait session‚Äù take place?

3) Does President Obama believe that Terry Richardson‚Äôs photography degrades women?

4) Given the credibility he helped give to Richardson by posing for and with him, do you believe President Obama should express regret for having done so given the sexually graphic nature of Richardson‚Äôs photography and the way he presents women?

Despite several phone calls and e-mails over the course of four days, the White House did not respond.

CNSNews.com also tried to contact Terry Richardson for comment but he did not respond.

According to a March 2, 2012 article in The New York Times, Richardson stopped giving interviews in 2010, saying that his work should ‚Äúspeak for itself.‚Äù

Time to Ground AIRCLAIRE

Once upon a time Claire McCaskill was the State Auditor for Missouri. Then she became a U.S. Senator. Now she has decided to write campaign ads for the GOP candidates who will run against her next year.

Claire and her husband own a plane. They formed a company for this plane. Then Claire paid tax dollars to this company for her use of her own plane to fly back and forth to Missouri. This would be like you or I using our own vehicle on company business, but billing the company the going rate of a car rental. Federal law provides an allowable use rate for personal vehicles, but doesn't specify a policy for use of personal aircraft. It's hard to believe that the $76,000 Claire has charged taxpayers since 2007 would be an acceptable allowance if such a policy existed.

Since being ""caught"", AirClaire has agreed to reimburse the U.S. Taxpayers in the amount of $88,000 although she claims the charges were legal. She's right - they were technically legal. But it's very hard to claim they were ethical.

McCaskill spokesman, Maria Speiser said, ""Sen. McCaskill has been very careful flying on taxpayer dollars."" Apparently not careful enough seeing that she has now been caught.

Claire, as a Senator, has been very aggressive in pursuing waste and transparency for travel by lawmakers. But in the typical Washington hypocrisy, she meant others, not herself. This is the same hypocrisy that allows Al Gore to rant about the consumption of average everyday citizens, while his own use would rival that of mid-size towns. Or Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, the head of our tax collections, but who had been negligent in paying his own taxes.

Senator McCaskill proposed legislation in February of this year that would terminate the employment of Federal employees who are delinquent in their taxes. Would that mean all the Obama appointments who had trouble paying their taxes are now ineligible to be Federal Employees?

Claire wasn't done writing ads for her opponent in next year's Senate campaign, though. After reviewing her records, Claire has found that she owes St. Louis County, $287,000 in property taxes on her plane. Senator McCaskill is a Federal employee who is delinquent in paying her taxes, so she must obviously be let go. In fact, if Claire wanted to avoid being hypocritical, she would simply resign at this point.

At this point, I'm tired of hearing this same story. Why are there different rules for politicians like Claire McCaskill, Tim Geithner, Tom Daschle and many, many more? Then these same politicians want to crack down on the lower classes or raise our taxes at the same time. How can anyone believe that they are on our side?

McCaskill's spokesperson said that she ""understands that the optics"" involved in the use of her own plane at taxpayer expense looks bad. I'm sure there is a similar statement to be made about the back taxes she owes, too. But the bigger optics problem is the fact that Senator McCaskill can pull out her checkbook and write checks for nearly $400,000 and expect that to be the end of it.

I understand that people will make mistakes from time to time. But if I make a $40,000 mistake, I will be hounded by the government every day. My phone will be ringing off the hook, wages garnished, fines and fees will be added, my tax refunds confiscated. I can't write a check for $40,000 even if I wanted to, so this mistake will be with me for several years.

But AirClaire's mistake is 10 times that and she thinks paying it off and selling the plane is good enough. There's you optics problem, Claire. As Mark Hemingway at the Weekly Standard blog put it,

Ah Senators, they're just like you and me! Who among us hasn't forgotten to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes on our private aircraft, after billing the government to use it 88 times? But because McCaskill is getting folksy with her admission of wrongdoing -- she said the word 'damn,' so clearly she takes this matter very seriously -- all is forgiven, right?

Perhaps Claire is simply a bad auditor. Maybe she just isn't Patriotic enough as Vice President Biden would put it. Or it is exactly what it seems - Claire and other politicians have one set of rules for us, but a different set of rules for themselves. This is of course the text book definition of hypocrisy - ""Some for me, but none for thee"".

We've watched Claire say one thing, then do another on the important legislation in Washington. Politicians lie to the voters all the time. But stealing from them is very different and should not go unpunished. We must exercise our right to terminate Claire's employment with the Federal Government. It's time to ground AirClaire.

"It can‚Äôt be. A 10-year-old girl? No. Not even if her mother is, as she claims, one of the founding members of Bust (which, by the way, has gone significantly downhill in the past two years because a) it‚Äôs expensive as shit and b) it‚Äôs always about arts n‚Äô crafts and kissing some minor celebrity‚Äôs ass). It reads like a grownup woman‚Äôs idea of what a 10-year-old girl sounds like. It‚Äôs how I would write a blog if I were pretending to be a 10-year-old.

This made me think about how I wrote in my own diary. I got my first diary as a gift from my grandmother, who probably bought it at the Ben Franklin store. This store was on Grand right next to Sears, which used to be a gorgeous old department store building but has since been torn down to make room for a discount ghetto furniture store (not unlike the below, which cracks me up every time because its twin is right down the street from my house) and apartments for old people who are clearly too demented to care about their new shitty neighborhood. The Ben Franklin store building is still there, by the way, only now it‚Äôs an Afghani grocery store that Graham says sells amazing flatbread but I‚Äôve never been inside.

Man, I really wish that Ben Franklin store was still there. My grandmother would take me there once every couple of weeks, and my favorite part was putting a dime into the machine full of plastic eggs and a chicken. You‚Äôd put the money in and the chicken would cluck and spin around, and then an egg would drop down the chute. It was always holding some crappy plastic toy, but in a town where I was angry about never having seen a Zoltar machine, the clucking chicken would have to do.

Right, the diary.

My grandmother bought me my first diary for a birthday gift. I had to be in fourth grade, because this is when I first started liking boys and because the Internet did not exist back then (at least not in any form that anyone I knew was even remotely aware), I had to write about it somewhere. The cover was plasticy blue cardboard with a kitten on it. A fucking kitten. Seriously. It also had a lock with a little key, but it wasn‚Äôt very secure because I lost the key in about a month and broke the lock apart with my bare hands. My super strong, skinny girl, fourth grade hands.

I probably wrote sort of like The Life Of a 10-Year-Old Girl, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I used more commas. Also I used page breaks, which seemed logical to me but probably didn‚Äôt matter much considering the diary pages were just slightly bigger than playing cards. While I sort of wish I had that diary to read again, I‚Äôm mostly glad I don‚Äôt, because the amount of cringing I‚Äôd have to do would likely warp my brain into a psychological meltdown.

Hey, 10-Year-Old Me, let me break it down for you‚Ä¶

That boy you like? He likes you back. Don‚Äôt get too excited, because he only likes you back as much as a 10-year-old boy can like you back, which means he‚Äôs still going to invite you to play hockey and tag and he might try to kiss you a couple of times (although you will be too terrified to reciprocate) but that‚Äôs pretty much it. By the time he starts liking girls in a different way, he won‚Äôt like you anymore. Well, not like you want to be liked. Instead, he‚Äôll like the slutty burnout girls who steal their dad‚Äôs weed because their dad is an alcoholic who‚Äôs never home and thinks nothing of all the kids coming over to party in his hot tub. (You‚Äôre not missing anything by not going to these parties, by the way.)

There‚Äôs no point in writing about who‚Äôs dating who in your grade, because ‚Äì and trust me, I struggled with being this callous towards someone who thinks she‚Äôs at the absolute height of her maturity ‚Äì nobody knows ANYTHING about dating at your age. All those conversations your parents try to have about the difference between ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù and ‚Äúdating?‚Äù Yeah, you‚Äôre just as clueless as they are. There is no difference, and the people who get married to the people they started dating in junior high are going to have future affairs with people they meet on the Internet.

You are going to love the Internet.

But why am I saying this? You‚Äôre only concerned with that boy. Okay, fine. I did say that the boy likes you back in a sort of innocent, jejune, not-at-all-knowledgeable-about-sex-no-matter-what-he-says way. And I did say that he‚Äôs going to be way into hoodrat girls within the next couple of years. BUT you should also know that he‚Äôs going to be into you someday, in the way that you want him to be, and that someday will be in adulthood, at which point you will sleep with him‚Ä¶and be underwhelmed.

SO all those pages where you wrote agonizingly about how he‚Äôs ‚Äúdating‚Äù a friend of yours and you‚Äôre really truly ‚Äúhappy for them‚Äù (you liar)? Guess what. You get to sleep with him and she marries someone and has three kids. Who wins that game? YOU WIN THAT GAME.

Getting married and having kids is stupid. Don‚Äôt ever do it.

The clucking chicken machine at Ben Franklin was AWESOME!

The potential shoreline damage risk in that scenario due to new pipeline infrastructure and tanker traffic would weight my thinking (I'd feel very differently if it doubled potential damage vs., say, a 1% increase in potential damage).

Honestly, I'm conflicted. I think we grotesquely under-price the value of our environment in so many ways.

"Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) Monday retweeted actor and comedian Tom Arnold celebrating the brutal lawn assault on Sen. Rand Paul which left the senator with six broken ribs and a bruised lung.

‚ÄúImagine being Rand Paul‚Äôs next door neighbor and having to deal with Rand Paul lying cowardly circular whiney bullcrap about lawn clippings,‚Äù Arnold tweet ‚Äî reposted by Omar ‚Äî read. ‚ÄúNo wonder he ripped his toupee off.‚Äù

Paul‚Äôs neighbor tackled him last year, infuriated by the senator‚Äôs habit of stacking lawn debris near the line between two properties.

This comes after last week Paul said he was willing to contribute to buying Omar a ticket to visit Somalia to ‚Äúlearn a little bit about the disaster that is Somalia‚Äù so she‚Äôd stop saying bad things about America.

Omar retweeting Arnold, of course, is being seen as a WTF moment by many, including Paul‚Äôs communications director Sergio Gor, who called the post ‚Äúabhorrent‚Äù:

Jackson Leyden had always been a healthy kid; he practiced taekwondo, and he played lacrosse and baseball. But in 2011, a few months after his eighth birthday, he began having seizures several times a day. Many were brief, a half-minute of staring into space, but he also had severe episodes in which he would collapse, sometimes injuring himself. Over the next two years, he was hospitalized about 50 times, and he missed much of fourth and fifth grade.
CBD E-Liquid/Vape Cartridges: Vaping is excellent for people looking for an immediate response, as inhalation is the fastest way to deliver CBDs to your brain and body. To use vape simply exhale gently the air from your lungs then inhale through the mouthpiece slowly for 3 seconds. Then fill your lungs the rest of the way with additional breath and hold for a few seconds, exhaling when ready. There are pre-filled, cost-effective vape pens and cartridges available as well as more expensive vaporizers that you can refill with CBD-infused e-liquid.
CBD does not appear to have any psychotropic (""high"") effects such as those caused by ‚àÜ9-THC in marijuana, but may have anti-anxiety and anti-psychotic effects.[12] As the legal landscape and understanding about the differences in medical cannabinoids unfolds, it will be increasingly important to distinguish ""medical marijuana"" (with varying degrees of psychotropic effects and deficits in executive function) ‚Äì from ""medical CBD therapies‚Äù which would commonly present as having a reduced or non-psychoactive side effect profile.[12][57]

People claim that cannabis oil can be used to treat a wide range of conditions, though evidence to back up these claims is often lacking. For example, according to Medical News Today, people use cannabis oil for conditions ranging from pain to acne; some even claim the oil can cure diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer. (But again, there is no clinical evidence to support these claims.)

That being said, it was unlikely that the federal government was interested in pursuing individuals complying with state-mandated regulations surrounding legalized cannabis for recreational use, although the CSA law still gives them authority to do so. However, the new Trump administration may change this thinking and users of legal marijuana and legal dispensaries await further action and clarifying rules.

Over decades, researchers have found that THC may help treat pain, nausea, loss of appetite and other problems, while CBD was thought to be biologically inactive in humans. But in the past 10 years, scientists have concluded that CBD may be quite useful. Dozens of studies have found evidence that the compound can treat epilepsy as well as a range of other illnesses, including anxiety, schizophrenia, heart disease and cancer.

Hemp oil is a ""drying oil"", as it can polymerize into a solid form. Due to its polymer-forming properties, hemp oil is used on its own or blended with other oils, resins, and solvents as an impregnator and varnish in wood finishing, as a pigment binder in oil paints, and as a plasticizer and hardener in putty. It has uses similar to linseed oil and characteristics similar to tung oil.[31]

Can CBD oil help anxiety? Cannabidiol (CBD) is a chemical occurring in cannabis plants. It is possible to add CBD oil to food, and an increasing amount of evidence suggests that it may improve mental health, particularly anxiety. It does not seem to have adverse side effects, but CBD oil is illegal in some states. Learn more about CBD oil here. Read now

"I think most Canadians wish the government would apply more ingenuity and resources toward addressing the issue of tax evasion and offshore tax havens, and less time making tax policy ""fair"".  Funny how tax policy has to be the same for people who jumped into earning right out of high school or undergrad education, vs those who have spent 10-15 years deferring their earning potential to acquire the necessary skills and education to take care of other Canadians.  To me, in this case, ""equal"" doesn't translate to ""fair"".  Where was ""fair"" when these doctors were working 36 hour shifts for multiple years,  underwriting the costs of medical care with their servitude?  Why is it suddenly unfair to allow doctors, or other small business owners, who have self-funded, deferred income, taken risks, delayed having families often, and sacrificed hugely of personal time, to reap a financial reward greater than that of people who took a far easier and shorter road?

We have one doctor who said Terri was watching him. And we have another doctor who said Terri was cortically blind. We can report those two facts as is. But no one has come out and judged that the autopsy report is right and Cheshire is wrong, so we cannot report that. Since Cheshire and Thogmartin are both doctors, we can't dismiss one out of hand over the other. They both qualify as """"expert testimony"""". If some plumber testified in court that Terri was watching him, then I think we could argue that we could take that out as incorrect information and rely on Thogmartin alone. But this is doctor-versus-doctor, and all we can do is report who said what. As it is now, Cheshire says Terri watched him, and then parenthesis point out the autopsy two weeks later says something different. So, the conflicting facts are present next to each other. That's all we can do and remain npov.  15:21, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Since I heaped praise upon ' for his balanced and non-extremist POV, it is only fair that I give ' credit for not pushing his POV, even though he doesn't appear to me to always abide by this high standard. In rebuttal to , below, I must point out that ALL doctors have an opinion, and while I admit that Cheshire did not examine Terri as much as some doctors, I must point out that:

# Cheshire examined Terri a heck of a lot more than WE did;
# Cheshire is a whole heck of a lot more qualified than WE are (even with my double major in the sciences, biology and chemical science -with honors); and, lastly,
# Any lack of examination on his part is NOT his fault, but the judges' fault (judges, plural possessive), and let's recap.
# Thogmartin and crew were reporting their opinions too.

Besides, Cheshire may NOT have been wrong when he said Terri """"looked"""" at him; Not only could she have turned and """"looked"""" at him by sound cues (3-D hearing depth perception by use of her ears, which were not in question), but also we have found examples in which people with half a brain (or less) have been very successful in life, thus raising the possibility that TERRI could have been able to see, think, feel, etc. (I give credit to other editors, like '''''' who were more resourceful at finding -and posting -examples of cases of """"half-brain, but aware and intelligent people,""""  which I've seen in passing on the Internet.

The converse is true also. I believe the medical literature has reported cases in which the brain looked fairly normal but the person was PVS. In fact, I don't have to go to the medical literature for that one: We have several editors who act and look """"normal"""" but are really PVS. (Yuk, yuk yuk!) 13:""",0,en,0

I don't know if it's the same issue I had: when using <core-pages> it was scrolling beyond the content of the smaller tabs. Each pages had the same size as the biggest page.
Nothing worked except replacing <core-pages> with <animated-core-pages> which made the problem magically disappear.
I had a similar problem with <core-scaffold> from the starter project which was different from the version downloaded by bowser (the same day). A bug disappeared when using the latter.
Tldr: Maybe the starter project is not up-to-date.
PS: this fixed the pages size problem not the fact that the scroll position is keeped across pages.

Hope this helps!

A:

yes as the gentlemen before me said.
In order for the second spinner to get the correct index to set the list, 
you need to populate it after the first spinner is clicked.
/* wrong answer deleted */
if this is my code i would change addItemsOnSpinner2() into:
private void addItemsOnSpinner2(int selectedIndex){
    int positionTop = selectedIndex;
    //rest is the same
    /* ... */
}

and again insert these into addItemsOnSpinner1():
spinner1.setOnItemSelectedListener(new OnItemSelectedListener(){
        @Override
        public void onItemSelected(AdapterView<?> arg0, View arg1,int arg2, long arg3) {
            if(arg2>0)
            addItemsOnSpinner2(arg2);
        }
        @Override
        public void onNothingSelected(AdapterView<?> arg0) {
            addItemsOnSpinner2(0);
        }}
    );

that is just how i would do it
i think many ways works here though
edit2:oh and edit the addItemsOnSpinner2() in onCreate() into addItemsOnSpinner2(0)
edit3:you need to call addItemsOnSpinner2() in onCreate(), otherwise your spinner is empty!
edit4:sorry guys, i made a huge mistake into thinking onItemClickListener could be applied here, shame on me :((
btw, if you want to keep the index (under situation like change of screen orientation or back to foreground ) , it needs more complicated work
but here is a much simpler method:
1.set a global static variable: int selectedIndex;
2.in onCreate, set selectedIndex to 0 if savedInstanceState is null
3.in onCreate, after savedInstanceState is nullcheckd, call addItemsOnSpinner2(selectedIndex)
4.in spinner1's listener, set selectedIndex to selected index.
not guarranteed to work on every machine though:(

"RIDE DIRTY: A Raven Riders Novella (1001 Dark Nights) by Laura Kaye

Publication Date: March 13, 2018

Genre: Contemporary Romance

Caine McKannon is all about rules. As the Raven Riders Sergeant-at-Arms, he prizes loyalty to his brothers and protection of his club. As a man, he takes pleasure wherever he can get it but allows no one close‚Äîbecause distance is the only way to ensure people can‚Äôt hurt you. And he‚Äôs had enough pain for a lifetime.

But then he rescues a beautiful woman from an attack.

Kids and school are kindergarten teacher Emma Kerry‚Äôs whole life, so she‚Äôs stunned to realize she has an enemy‚Äîand even more surprised to find a protector in the intimidating man who saved her. Tall, dark, and tattooed, Caine is unlike any man Emma‚Äôs ever known, and she‚Äôs as uncertain of him as she is attracted. As the danger escalates, Caine is in her house more and more ‚Äì until one night of passion lands him in her bed.

But breaking the rules comes at a price, forcing Caine to fight dirty to earn a chance at love.

~*~*~*~

I am a fan of the Raven Riders, but this novella was by far my favorite. Caine was taciturn, smolderingly sexy and if you can believe it‚Ä¶sweet. Thankfully I liked Emma, so I wasn‚Äôt jealous. I could relate to her immediately, believe her actions and know she was perfect for him. There was just enough danger to keep you tense, but not overshadow the sexy romance. Loved it! I only wish it was longer.

*Review copy provided by InkSlinger in exchange for an honest review.

~*~*~*~

Emma shifted, bringing her face closer to Caine‚Äôs. Close enough that if he just leaned up, he could have a taste of her again. ‚ÄúYou know what you are?‚Äù she asked.

Yeah. Yeah, he really fucking did. A jagged boulder slid into his gut. But he wanted to hear what she had to say. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the man who risked himself and saved me.‚Äù She blew out a shaky breath, and damn if her fear didn‚Äôt reach into his rib cage and make it hard to breathe. Or maybe what invaded his chest was his own fear‚Äîat realizing how close he‚Äôd been to losing Emma Kerry before he‚Äôd ever met her at all. White-hot anger lanced through him at the thought.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not done.‚Äù She pressed a soft kiss against his lips, and the freeness of her affection stunned him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre also the man who recognized that I was in danger and took it upon himself to watch over me and my house, to even talk to the police about it.‚Äù

He shrugged with one shoulder, his gaze falling somewhere in between them. ‚ÄúProviding protection, investigating threats, and installing security, this is what I do for the Ravens. I know you don‚Äôt know a lot about us, but we have a whole mission around defending people who can‚Äôt defend themselves. So I just slipped into that mode. But I should‚Äôve told you what was going on. I just‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt want to worry you until I was sure. And I didn‚Äôt‚Äîfuck, I know this was selfish‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt want you to hate me for letting the guy get away.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, you should‚Äôve told me. So I could be more aware and know I might need to defend myself. Look at me,‚Äù she said, tilting her face to try to align their gazes.

He lifted his and met those warm blues head on, ready for whatever criticism and anger she wanted to dish out.

‚ÄúBut last night, out on the street, you admitted you had something to tell me. And then you did. Just‚Ä¶next time, maybe tell me at the start, okay?‚Äù

Caine blinked. That was it?

‚ÄúAnd if you have any advice on how to make my voice louder or more convincing than the one in your head that keeps telling you I could ever hate you or that anything about my attack was your fault, could you please let me know?‚Äù

His jaw dropped, and Caine felt like he‚Äôd just walked cartoon-like into an unseen pole. This‚Ä¶this was just one more proof that this woman saw him. Right now, that wasn‚Äôt super fucking comfortable. But it was so foreign to be seen that he couldn‚Äôt do anything but bask in it, even if he felt utterly exposed.

‚ÄúFuck, Emma,‚Äù he managed, his thoughts too tangled to even attempt a meaningful answer to her question. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúTrying to let you know I care,‚Äù she said. Like it was obvious. Like it was normal. Like it wasn‚Äôt blowing his goddamn mind.

"Symmetry and asymmetry in idiotypic interactions.
At the level of antibody molecules, the partners in an idiotypic interaction are functionally equivalent, and the distinction between ""idiotype"" and ""anti-idiotype"" is merely operational. This point must be taken into account in the interpretation of regulatory experiments with ""idiotypic"" and ""antiidiotypic"" antibodies. Indeed, consistent interpretations of certain sets of data can be obtained if ""idiotype"" and ""antiidiotype"" are used as operational terms for functionally equivalent molecules with complementary binding sites. For interacting antibody populations, symmetrical and asymmetrical situations can occur. The latter case is when an antibody family whose members express a set of idiotypes in various combinations--a typical situation in germ-line encoded immune responses--interacts with a heterogenous population of anti-idiotypes, the common denominators of which are binding sites for the common idiotopes expressed in the idiotypic antibody family. Through this type of interaction, one can explain in a first approximation the experiments of Urbain, Cazenave and others in which antiidiotypic antibody populations (ab2) induce antibodies (ab3) which resemble the original idiotypic population (ab1) idiotypically, but not primarily in antigen-binding specificity. Such a model would also describe an idiotypic network in which germline-encoded recurrent idiotypes (expressed in antibody families of the type described above) interact with anti-idiotypes generated by somatic mutation.",1,en,1

Alberta's economy was flying high when the price of oil was up with the exact amount of pipelines we have at present.  The impact of one pipeline on the Alberta economy if the price of oil stays the same will be minimal.,0,en,0

"Q:

Copy a column and add a prefix to new column in R with dplyr

Does someone know how to copy a column in a data.frame and add a prefix to the new column? 
The idea is to have a character vector containing certain column names of a dataframe and to copy these with a prefix to subsequently perform an action upon. 
The reason is that I want to use the spread function on these columns, but as far as I know the spread function does not preserve the original column. What I would like:
From a data.frame with the following column names: 
column_names <- c('var1', 'var2', 'var3')

To a dataframe with the following columns
column_names <- c('var1', 'var2', 'var3', 'prefix_var1','prefix_var3')

Where the columns with 'prefix' contain the same data as their orginal columns.
What I've tried so far, which partially succeeded:
sel_columns <- c('var1', 'var3')

data <- data.frame(var1 = c(12,3,4), var2 = c(123,5435,121), var3 = c(23,456,123))

new_data <- data %>% mutate_at(one_of(sel_columns), funs(.))
#Error in eval(substitute(expr), envir, enclos) : 
#  could not find function ""var1""
#In addition: Warning message:
#In one_of(sel_columns) : Unknown variables: `var1`, `var3`

new_data2 <- data %>% select(one_of(sel_columns)) %>% mutate_all(funs(prefix = . * 1)) %>% c(data, .) %>% data.frame

A:

We can try this in base R
cbind(data, setNames(data[sel_columns], paste0(""prefix_"", sel_columns)))

#  var1 var2 var3 prefix_var1 prefix_var3
#1   12  123   23          12          23

Public Curious Over I-94 Billboard in Rogers

July 10, 2016

A billboard of a woman in a niqab went up on I-94 in Rogers at the beginning of June, prompting calls to the sign company from the public. Copy was added to the billboard in July, which now reads ‚ÄúShould America Fear Sharia?‚Äù

The billboard is sponsored by the Center for Security Policy, a Washington, D.C. based national security think tank. The site shouldamericafearsharia.org consists mostly of links to videos discussing different topics about Islam and Islamic extremism. The home page urges visitors to sign a petition to ban Sharia Law in the United States. The petition has gathered only 22 signatures as of July 9th.

The billboard was contracted out by the Center with Franklin Outdoor Advertising, a billboard company in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

‚ÄúThe billboard went up the beginning of June,‚Äù Franklin salesperson Chris Barta said, ‚ÄúLast Friday we switched it out and put up the one with the website.‚Äù

The website advertisement billboard will be up from July 1st through the end of the month when the advertisement contract expires.

The Center for Security Policy‚Äôs website contains articles and videos on national security threats of Islamic terrorism.

In the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, the Center‚Äôs executive vice president Jim Hanson called the attack, ‚Äúcompletely in keeping with totalitarian Islamic code called Shariah.‚Äù

Franklin Outdoor Advertising received a number of calls from the public regarding the billboard according to Barta, mostly in June when there was no text accompanying the image on the sign.

‚ÄúPeople were wondering what it was because it didn‚Äôt have anything but a woman in a burqa and they were wondering what it was,‚Äù Barta said, ‚ÄúThe majority of phone calls we fielded we just told them to wait for the website to go up.‚Äù",0,en,0

"The issue with environmental protection laws is that they are unfairly targeted by the malicious as trade barriers. It is completely legitimate to require compliance with environmental standards as a prerequisite to trade. This is an example of legislation in the public interest. This can easily be distinguished from protectionism: is the legislation a legitimate environmental measure, or not? 

Conversely, the argument can be made that lax or non-existent environmental regulations constitute an unfair subsidy to business in a particular jurisdiction. This is an incredibly powerful argument that can be used to raise interjurisdictional standards.

Compliance with  carbon pricing is potentially a big issue here. Why should we advantage american companies that don't have to comply with carbon pricing?

"Force-velocity characteristics of the knee extensors: an indication of the risk for physical frailty in elderly women.
To examine the relationship between muscle strength, speed of movement, muscle mass (MM), and functional performance in elderly women and to determine optimal threshold values below which physical frailty occurs. Survey. University-based laboratory. Institutionalized women (N=123; mean age, 79.67 ¬± 5.2y). Not applicable. Force-velocity characteristics of the knee extensors were evaluated by using isometric, isokinetic, and ballistic tests on a motor-driven dynamometer. Isometric (ISOM) strength, dynamic strength, maximal speed of movement (SoM, unloaded), and speed of movement with standardized resistance of 20% (S(20)), 40% (S(40)), and 60% (S(60)) of the isometric maximum were recorded. MM of the upper leg was determined by using computed tomography. The modified Physical Performance Test (mPPT) was used to assess functional performance. Force-velocity characteristics (r varied from .31-.68) and MM (r=.41) correlated significantly with functional performance (P<.05). In a forward stepwise regression model, only SoM and ISOM strength remained independently associated with mPPT score (R(2)=.49), with SoM accounting for most of the variance. The threshold value that optimally differentiates between women with mild (mPPT score, 25-31) or without (mPPT score ‚â•32) physical frailty was 350¬∞/s for SoM and 1.46N m/kg for ISOM strength. Sensitivity and specificity ranged from 74% to 77% and 71% to 77%, respectively. SoM is a key component in the onset of functional difficulties in elderly women. Exercise interventions specifically targeting muscle power (by including exercises at high velocities) thus might be crucial to prevent functional decline.",0,en,0

Also, if we look at wages many years after education, how relevant is this for today's graduates?  (A BA might have been a ticket to a good job 30-yrs ago, but maybe a welder's ticket is more beneficial today.)

"Christopher Fabian

Christopher Fabian (born April 18, 1980) is a technologist who co-founded UNICEF's Innovation Unit with Erica Kochi in 2006.  He currently runs UNICEF Ventures - and makes investments into open source technologies that can provide solutions to societal problems, particularly those facing children. Between 2007 and 2015 he held the role of Senior Advisor on Innovation to the Executive Director at UNICEF.  Fabian spent a year (2010) as Senior Advisor on Innovation to the Executive Office of the Secretary-General. In 2015 he led the launch of UNICEF‚Äôs Innovation Fund, a pooled funding vehicle built to quickly assess, fund and scale companies, teams, and ideas that have been developed in new and emerging markets.

Fabian is known for his work on tools for children and communities in low-infrastructure environments, including the Digital Drum, U-Report, and RapidSMS, which has evolved to RapidPro ‚Äî a free, open source framework for rapidly building mobile services for scale.

In 2013, he and Kochi were on the Time 100 list of global influencers.

Personal life and early work 
Fabian studied philosophy at the American University in Cairo and at Trinity College in Dublin. He also holds a degree in Media Studies from the New School in New York, NY.

Before joining UNICEF, Fabian founded companies in Africa and the Middle East.

Work at UNICEF 
Since 2007, Fabian has been Senior Advisor on Innovation to the Executive Director at UNICEF.  He co-founded UNICEF's Office of Innovation, which  focuses on connecting those with good ideas to those with the means to take them to scale. Since 2015, UNICEF convenes these networks of changemakers primarily through the Unit‚Äôs Innovation Fund and its Global Innovation Centre, which Fabian helped launch in 2015. The Global Innovation Centre, based in Nairobi, helps take successful ideas to scale and cultivates South-South innovation.

The Office of Innovation has developed open source tools for improving basic health and communication in low-infrastructure regions. It has helped build the largest mobile health system in the world in Nigeria, which has reported on more than 17M births by SMS. Other tools include U-Report, which enables over 3 million young people in 34 developing and developed countries to be connected to decision makers via SMS, and globally via Twitter. The Office of Innovation has also used real-time SMS to help stop the spread of Ebola, smartphones to register children after a disaster, and tablet-based games to teach kids in Sudan.

Fabian has advocated for technologists in the development space to incorporate UNICEF‚Äôs Innovation principles. These Principles, such as be open source, build with local technologists, and build for sustainability, are used widely in the international development community.

In 2011, Fabian advised on the creation of a framework of innovations labs linking WHO, UNDP, UNICEF as well as public and private-sector partners around in-country innovation. In 2013, Fabian helped launch the Child Friendly Technology Framework (CFT), 52 worksheets used for brainstorming and project planning when an idea for a project with a technology component is focused on children and adolescents. In 2015, Fabian designed the first Global Innovation Summit for Children, co-organised by UNICEF and the Ministry Foreign Affairs of Finland.

Fabian was also a producer of the virtual-reality film Clouds Over Sidra, created by Vrse.works. The film follows Sidra, a 12-year-old girl that has fled her home in Syria due to the ongoing crisis and found herself in Jordan‚Äôs Zaatari refugee camp.

UNICEF Innovation Fund and Ventures 
As of 2017, the Innovation Fund holds USD $11 million and has made over 30 investments in 26 countries, primarily in open source technology companies.  In 2016, it added a UNICEF Ventures fund for small, early-stage investments.  in 2016, Fabian has worked to build platforms that can allow for rapid development, testing, and deployment of new technologies and approaches to solving problems.  Ventures work has included investment in ‚Äúfrontier technology‚Äù such as Drones, UAVs, data science and machine learning. Examples include the UNICEF Drone Corridor in Malawi, in 2016, and the ""Magic Box"" platform for working with large realtime datasets. The Magic Box platform allows companies like IBM, Google, and Telefonica to pool data so it can be used to make realtime decisions in emergencies.

Lectures and philosophy 
Fabian believes that technology is not the end-product of innovation, but a driver of new ways of thinking about development problems. He talks about the importance of open-source projects, learning from failure, and having solutions designed and built by local talent.

He lectures about South-to-North and South-to-South innovation, and developed a ""Design for UNICEF"" course which he taught at New York University (co-taught with Clay Shirky) and Columbia University. He has also taught or lectured at the Art Center, Aalto University, Harvard University, IIT Delhi, Singularity University, and Tsinghua University.

"[Neuropsychiatry today (author's transl)].
Neurology and psychiatry are combined in the easily misunderstandable term ""Neuropsychiatry"" as equal ranking sister disciplines. Neurology with its rectilinear development and the gain in important auxiliary methods enjoys general high respect. It is quite different with psychiatry. It is tainted with the events of the National Socialist domination. Its logical therapeutic methods are associated with inhumanity. Etiology and pathogenesis of the ""endogenous"" psychoses are still veiled in darkness. This gap in knowledge, detrimental to the prestige of psychiatry, is filled with theories, hypotheses and speculations. An extensively popularized psychology questions some concepts of a classical psychiatry wrongly described as conservative. Such uncertainty is alive even in the ranks of psychiatrists, to the detriment of their responsibility. Psychiatry must serve the care of the individual patient, renouncing all possible temptations. Some success can be expected from the ""out-patient services"" but this demands professional knowledge and critical ability besides activity.",0,en,0

Manchus

In April you reverted my edits with the comment that """"This paragraph was vandalized from previous revisions. It drastically changed from its original source."""".

Whether the changes are justified or not, they were not vandalism as they were explained at the discussion page for Manchus (""""Manchus and political football""""). Before reverting edits on the strength of charges of vandalism, I would be grateful if you could check the talk page and first address arguments made there.

My objection to the statement that """"Much recent scholarship in ethnic identity emphasizes that ethnic categories, rather than being static and objective, are fluid and subjective"""" is the fact that this could apply to ANY ethnic group, and could thus be placed at any article on any ethnic group. Making this specific point only at the article on the Manchus sounds like a rationalisation or excuse. It sounds highly defensive, as though there is no real basis for asserting Manchu ethnic identity other than the over-subtle distinctions of academics. We know that Crossley argued from this point of view, but is it necessary to incorporate this in the article? It's almost as if the article were saying """"We know the Manchus are not considered an ethnic group, but if ethnicities are regarded as fluid and subjective, we can perhaps recognise them as such"""". 

The Qing dynasty was based on an apartheid-like situation where the Chinese and Manchus were kept apart. During the Qing the Manchus retained a consciousness of being a separate ethnic group, even after they mostly switched to speaking Chinese. There are still Manchus today who retain a consciousness of the separateness of Manchu culture, quite apart from the state-sponsored ethnic categories. So my point is, why do we have to bend over backwards to try and justify a viewpoint simply because it is at odds with the current consensus? Is there a need to be so pointedly defensive just in the case of the Manchus?

"Influence of natural settlement cues on the metamorphosis of fiddler crab megalopae, Uca vocator (Decapoda: Ocypodidae).
Megalopae of many decapod crab species accelerate their development time to metamorphosis (TTM) when exposed to natural physical and/or chemical cues characteristic of the parental habitat. In the present study, the influence of natural settlement cues on the moulting rates and development TTM in megalopae of the fiddler crab Uca vocator was investigated. The effects of mud from different habitats (including well-preserved and degraded-polluted mangrove habitats) and conspecific adult 'odours' (seawater conditioned with crabs) on the induction of metamorphosis were compared with filtered pure seawater (control). 95 to 100% of the megalopae successfully metamorphosed to first juvenile crab stage in all treatments, including the control. However, the development TTM differed significantly among treatments. Settlement cues significantly shortened development, while moulting was delayed in their absence. The fact that megalopae responded to metamorphosis-stimulating cues originating from both adult and non-adult benthic habitats demonstrates that settlement in this species may occur in a wider range of habitats within the mangrove ecosystem, including impacted areas.",0,en,0

"High-speed light field camera and frequency division multiplexing for fast multi-plane velocity measurements.
Non-intrusive fast 3d measurements of volumetric velocity fields are necessary for understanding complex flows. Using high-speed cameras and spectroscopic measurement principles, where the Doppler frequency of scattered light is evaluated within the illuminated plane, each pixel allows one measurement and, thus, planar measurements with high data rates are possible. While scanning is one standard technique to add the third dimension, the volumetric data is not acquired simultaneously. In order to overcome this drawback, a high-speed light field camera is proposed for obtaining volumetric data with each single frame. The high-speed light field camera approach is applied to a Doppler global velocimeter with sinusoidal laser frequency modulation. As a result, a frequency multiplexing technique is required in addition to the plenoptic refocusing for eliminating the crosstalk between the measurement planes. However, the plenoptic refocusing is still necessary in order to achieve a large refocusing range for a high numerical aperture that minimizes the measurement uncertainty. Finally, two spatially separated measurement planes with 25√ó25 pixels each are simultaneously acquired with a measurement rate of 0.5 kHz with a single high-speed camera.",0,en,0

Yes, any compound of carbon that can be synthesised, can be synthesised from carbon that comes from captured atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$.

We discussed related subjects recently on the new Sustainability Stack Exchange, on the options for plastics without oil.

There are at least three research outfits working on the atmospheric extraction of $\ce{CO2}$. Now, inevitably, capturing it and turning it back into carbon is going to take more energy than gets released from burning coal or gas in the first place to release the $\ce{CO2}$, but that doesn't make the chemistry impossible (and it isn't a deal-breaker economically either, because energy costs vary hugely by time and space.)

And as the article from the UK's Royal Chemistry Society from Jan 2012 that you linked to, highlights, this is already being done:

Graphene oxide can be easily reduced to graphene but is also useful in its own right ... Lee and colleagues produced graphene oxide through a two-step process: first, they fixed the $\ce{CO2}$ to ammonia borane ($\ce{NH3BH3}$) and then they heated the resulting solid to create a honeycomb structure of graphene oxide. In the first reaction, they placed $\ce{NH3BH3}$ into a stainless steel cell and then added $\ce{CO2}$ until the cell reached a target pressure. They then gradually heated the cell to 100¬∞C over a few hours. At a pressure of about 30atm, the mass of the $\ce{NH3BH3}$ doubled thank to the addition of carbon dioxide, producing $\ce{OCH3}$, $\ce{HCOO}$ and aliphatic groups.

"`  ::: Hi Marcuse. I see you've run into Sojambi Pinola. don't mind him, he's a buffoon. He is friend of Biff Rose's. They mention each other on their respective web spots. Looks like the two of them are on here basahing other people until they stand alone as edit king. Too bad someone else wrote about Rose's own anti semiticism, and racism. Poor Sojambi has been trying to fix it ever since. The sad thing is, he is so one sided, he has a difficult time persuading others of his NPOV- therefore he lashes out, and you were caught up in the crossfire(evidence here[]) Notice, he's only comparing what he wants you to see. the connection? well there isn't any really, but by creative use of wiki skills he tries to cover his own manipulations by using hanging you up as the villain. It's a rather typical obfuscation tehnique. By accusing every person who posts something that makes an edit to his work, he then marks them as a bad user. It's also reminiscent of those toubling Republican smear tactics of last year- only translated to this site. He's a schmuck. Claims to be latino, then claims to be jewish, then claims to be black, then claims to be white. Next he'll claim to be a woman. He's already claimed to be a few other people, and it was his vandalism of other peoples talk page and of the Rose page itself that got it frozen in the first place. Also of note is his complete inability to sleuth. I would find his ``detective`` skills humorous if they weren't so evil. good luck, and I bet your singing voice would improve, if only you would practice. `",0,en,0

"A 17-year-old boy has been sentenced to six years in prison after attacking a trans man, leaving his victim with a brain bleed and broken nose.

The 40-year-old trans man was walking down a road in the town of Aylesbury ‚Äì to the north-west of London ‚Äì at 10:50pm on a Monday last July when he was accosted by a group of men.

Owen Wise, 17, of Kingham Court, New Street, Aylesbury, verbally abused his victim, making references to him being trans, before stealing his phone and wallet.

After taking the items, Wise punched him in the face, knocking his victim to the ground and causing a bleed to the brain, a broken nose and a cheek wound.

Wise, who was 16 at the time, pleaded guilty to one count of robbery in December and was sentenced to six years today, on the basis that the attack was a hate crime.

Michael Thorpe, aged 21, of Beech Green, Aylesbury, was also arrested on 28 July 2016, and sentenced today to two years and three months after pleading guilty to one count of theft.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Bruce Wilson, of Aylesbury Local CID, said: ‚ÄúThis was an appalling unprovoked attack against a man due to his transgender status and was motivated by hate.

‚ÄúThis incident had a significant and long lasting impact upon the victim ‚Äì not just physically but emotionally.‚Äù

Kaviraj Choolun, Senior Crown Prosecutor from Thames and Chiltern CPS, said: ‚ÄúThis case involved the robbery of a 40-year-old transgender man, motivated by hate, which resulted in horrendous long-lasting injuries.‚Äù

Choolun said even though Owen Wise was just 16 at the time of the robbery, he was ‚Äúthe ringleader of those involved.

‚ÄúHe pleaded guilty to robbery, but denied targeting the victim due to vulnerability and claimed to have only hit him once. He is clearly an extremely violent and dangerous individual.

‚ÄúMichael Thorpe did not use any violence during the incident, but was part of the group when the robbery took place and the group used hate as a motive.

‚ÄúHe admitted to stealing the victim‚Äôs mobile phone during the robbery and pleaded guilty to theft.‚Äù

Choolun emphasised that ‚Äúfrom the outset, the CPS said this offence was a hate crime aggravated by transphobic hostility and persisted in prosecuting it as a hate crime‚Äù.

The CPS continued doing so, he added, ‚Äúdespite the victim being unable to give evidence, even via video link, due to the dreadful physical and psychological effects resulting from his head injury.

‚ÄúWe know that nothing can undo what happened to the victim, but we hope that the convictions and today‚Äôs sentences bring him at least a small sense that justice has been done.

‚ÄúWe also hope that the victim, who has shown great courage throughout this process, continues with his recovery. Our thoughts are very much with him at this time.‚Äù",0,en,0

"Q:

How much is paid in taxes if the Homeowners Tax Deduction equals a person's Income Tax amount (USA, FL)

I was wondering how much of a yearly tax payment could be deducted using the homeowners tax deduction. I know that the policy allows for a deduction of the interest payments amount for up to $750,000. So if the interest payment amount is higher than your income tax amount, is it possible to pay $0 income tax? What would actually happen?
To put some numbers to this:
Lets say a person earns $80,000 a year and their tax rate every year (lets say just income tax for this question) is around $20,000 a year. If the interest payments on the house are $20,000 a year, what would happen if this person opted to use the homeowner's deduction? Do they pay 0% income tax since $20,000 - $20,000 = 0?
This doesn't seem right. What would actually happen?

A:

Nope it does not work like that, what you are referring to is a tax credit there are some but the interest rate deduction is a reduction of their income not taxes paid.  
In your hypothetical case, their income would be 60K (80k-20k) and they would pay around 15K in taxes.  Granted it is not as easy as that, but close enough for illustrative purposes.
There are things like the earned income tax credit, that if it did get as high as 20K, this hypothetical person would pay zero in taxes

Why would you want Overhaul to touch someone else's engine when they weren't even capable of properly updating the engine most of them were part of making in the first place?

What don't you agree with? That they added bugs that weren't there in the original? They did. From broken THAC0 display to dialog scripting errors. Not to mention the broken ass journal. And the fact that they can't even set up the engine to save your zoom settings. Not to mention the hardware incompatibilities they just neglected to work around. FFS, they took a 15 year old game that works on everything today without a hitch, and they made it NOT WORK on a large number of modern systems.

Do you disagree that they've failed Apples not stringent certification procedures? Cuz they had the iOS port thrown back at them weeks ago and yesterday Oster posted that they failed again when submitting the OSX port to Apple? Cuz y'know, they did.

The new content is one of their big selling points, and it was garbage too. The scaling is hideous. They removed configuration options that BG1 had available. The new cinematics are painful and somehow subpar to the originals. Which already sucked!

And they're charging $20 for this slap in the face of history. For a game you could buy on GOG cheaper (or probably already own) and get a superior experience with. Then you can mod it and make it an INCREDIBLY superior experience.

"Normal superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene in pregnancy-induced hypertension: is the decreased SOD activity a secondary phenomenon?
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). A genetic factor is also thought to be associated with the disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in PIH resulted from gene abnormalities. Fourteen patients with PIH were enrolled in the study. Normal pregnant women and normal nonpregnant women served as controls. Genomic DNA and mRNA were isolated from white cells and subjected to Southern and Northern blot analysis with a 600 bp CuZn-SOD probe. SOD activity was also determined in the white blood cells and red blood cells. The results showed that SOD activity was significantly reduced in patients with PIH compared to both control groups. There were no significant differences in the size of the CuZn-SOD gene and its expression between the patients with PIH and the controls. This study confirmed that there was a decreased SOD activity in PIH but revealed neither major structural changes in the genomic DNA nor mRNA size of CuZn-SOD. Our results suggest that the decreased SOD levels in PIH are not due to abnormalities in the CuZn-SOD gene and are an acquired phenomenon which occurs during the development of the disease.",0,en,0

"Ross Cameron is a conservative former Australian MP for Parramatta who earned a slew of dubious headlines this week after a homophobic speech he gave to Sydney‚Äôs right-wing Q Society surfaced.

He‚Äôs also currently employed by Sky as the host of a political show, and he found himself at the mercy of a colleague who wasn‚Äôt willing to let him off the hook about the speech.

Related: News Anchor Jokes About All The Women Steve Grand Dates, But The Joke‚Äôs On Her

Not that the speech is defensible in any way. In it, he referred to the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper as the ‚ÄúSydney Morning Homosexual‚Äù and then claims the Liberal Party is ‚Äúbasically a gay club.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind that they are gay,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúI just wish, like Hadrian, they would build a wall. ‚Äù

To give a sense of exactly what kind of event this was, a ring-wing cartoonist made the following ‚Äújoke‚Äù:

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stand Muslims‚Ä¶ [but] they are not all bad, they do chuck pillow-biters off buildings.‚Äù

That‚Äôs why his colleague, television host Janine Perrett, went after him on live television.

After prodding Cameron to explain his speech, he said, ‚ÄúI gave a very pro-gay speech in which I said that gays have been associated with the creative class since the beginning of history.‚Äù

Related: ‚ÄúGirl, He Hit The Pole‚Äù Is The Best News Interview You‚Äôll See Today ‚Äî Or Ever!

‚ÄúBut it was derogatory,‚Äù Perrett said. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt it? You weren‚Äôt giving them a good rap.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll accept it was a gag but I don‚Äôt regard it as anti-gay,‚Äù Cameron responded. ‚ÄúI would say that I didn‚Äôt make a single, if you go through my remarks, I don‚Äôt see a single sentence of my remarks that is critical of gays.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat I object to is the Sydney Morning Herald taking the view that the vast sweep of Australians are homophobic, racist, rednecks.‚Äù

When Perrett asked whether he‚Äôll issue an apology, Cameron said the media took his remarks ‚Äúout of context.‚Äù

Then he added, ‚ÄúIf the reporting of these comments has caused someone to feel a greater sense of isolation over their attraction, then I very sincerely apologize.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was the worst apology I have ever heard,‚Äù Perrett shot back. ‚ÄúSo if they weren‚Äôt reported, then you wouldn‚Äôt apologize?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt accept‚Ä¶ if you read my speech, it was in defense of dissent,‚Äù Cameron said.

‚ÄúYou knew this was going to come out publicly,‚Äù Perrett said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just use the Donald Trump ‚Äòlocker room talk‚Äô defense.‚Äù

‚ÄúI regard that as one of the strengths of the argument,‚Äù Cameron said.

Police Capt. Andy Frear declined to discuss how police determined that she was the robber. Police had initially said they were seeking a clean-shaven black male wearing a red sweat shirt and khaki pants.

Heh. I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb here that if this chick is actually white, and therefore wasn‚Äôt the original suspect, that we will be seeing a big fat totally justified racial profiling lawsuit out there in Johnstown.

Just a hunch I‚Äôm having due to the Captain‚Äôs refusal to discuss it.

"Art:  Strangely enough Gilead licensed Sovaldi to the Indian drug makers for generic production exclusively in developing companies.  I guess even Giliad recognizes they won't make any money trying to price gouge Bangladeshis.   Americans, on the other hand, are a different story.  Sovaldi was originally developed by an American University (using U.S. Government grant funding), and Gilead got involved by paying 11 billion dollars to purchase the rights.  They paid that much because they wanted to be the first to bring a Hep C drug to market, knowing that insurance companies wouldn't be able to deny dying Hep C patients treatment, whatever the cost, so they could charge whatever they wanted.  Even with the high price of buying in, they have still reaped billions in profits.

"A letter of gratitude to #MuslimahPride social media jihadis

Dear Muslimaat,

I don‚Äôt have words to express my gratitude and appreciation for your noble battle against evil. Your #MuslimahPride movement against #Femen was a slap on the collective face of Western imperialists who believe that Muslim women can‚Äôt fight for a cause. It was also a resounding reminder for the rest of the world that you have what it takes to spark a revolution. What the ignorant world does not realise is that once you have the permission of your husbands, fathers, brothers, uncles, the approval of your neighbours, in-laws, their relatives and the consent of your spiritual guardians, their God and their scriptures, you can be quite the rebels.

It takes a lot of courage to ridicule something that is already taboo where you live. It takes volumes of bravery and valour to bow down to the status quo, and toe the lines that have been forced upon you. It takes unbelievable amounts of gallantry to act out a script that someone else has written for you. And it must take guts and the proverbial cojones to take a stand against cruelty and the personification of tyranny that a horde of topless women is.

Who on earth are those damn Europeans to try to steal your voice? Do they not realise that your lives were defined a million-and-a-half ago by the Arabs, who protected your rights and guarded your modesty by ensuring that you don‚Äôt have much of a say in most things? Who are those unabashed infidels to protest on your behalf? Do they not realise that you are not allowed to express, let alone clamour in favour of, anything that contradicts the ostensibly divine scriptures? Who are those shameless activists to try and liberate you? Do they not realise that you can‚Äôt be liberated without the permission of your mehrams?

I can‚Äôt thank you enough for choosing to be more offended by naked bodies than dead bodies. And since there are so many different kinds of you to thank, I‚Äôll try to address you one by one.

Dear ‚Äòguardians of modesty‚Äô Muslimaat, thank you for letting patriarchal societies define ‚Äòmodesty‚Äô for you. Thank you for accepting contrasting definitions of modesty for men and women, and for not being a source of strength for your sisters and daughters, vindicating the men‚Äôs claim of you being the weaker sex. Thank you for teaching your daughters about the sin that having sex is, throughout their lives, and then compelling them to do it immediately with a man they first met a couple of hours ago, after signing a few papers and getting the clergy‚Äôs approval. Also, thank you for blaming your fellow women when they are raped, since men have the divine license to refuse to keep their emotions in the right place. And thank you very very much for being more misogynistic than any male chauvinist can ever possibly be.

Dear ‚Äòfeminist‚Äô Muslimaat, thank you for being a ray of hope for bacon-eating vegetarians, god-fearing atheists and peace-loving terrorists. Thank you for reiterating the fact that your mehrams choose to overlook the divine orders and allow you to think freely and take your own decisions. Thank you for citing your personal example to highlight how you wear the hijab by your own choice, ignoring the fact that an overwhelming majority of Muslim women are coerced into doing so. Thank you very much for making the whole debate about you, when it was always about the torment and suffering that most of the Muslim women are going through.

Dear ‚Äòliberal‚Äô Muslimaat, thank you for defying the orders of your deity by choosing to not cover your heads. Thank you for disregarding other restrictions that your religion commands, and then having the audacity to condemn someone who is critical of these very commands. Thank you for cherry picking the commandments and making your ideology sound compatible with the 21st century, only to castigate those that take the same ideological orders literally and implement them. Thanks a lot for elucidating that you don‚Äôt need liberation and for paying no heed to the fact that the most of the women in your country do. And thank you very much for clinging on to those very shackles that have enchained the prospect of women empowerment in your country.

Dear ‚Äòrevolutionary‚Äô Muslimaat, thank you for ignoring the life threats that Amina Tyler and many others like her are facing, after choosing to protest against the harassment that they have to bear on a daily basis. Thank you for overlooking other lesser issues like terrorists attacking a 15-year-old schoolgirl; female genital mutilation; women being raped with judicial approval just so they don‚Äôt die virgins; two-year-old girls being forced to wear veils because the disgusting men in your country have no self-control; and fathers legally getting away with raping their daughters by paying a few riyals. Thank you very much for screaming bloody murder over half-naked women‚Äôs claim of representing you, but accepting rapists, pedophiles and sorry excuses for human beings as your state leaders and role models.

#MuslimahPride is not just a hashtag, it‚Äôs a symbol of integrity and pride. It‚Äôs about taking pride in inequality, in half testimonies, in blaming rape victims and in gender discrimination. It‚Äôs about taking pride in chauvinism, where men have divine permission to beat and rape their wives, marry multiple times and possess slave girls. It‚Äôs about taking pride in patriarchal societies where husbands are categorically told in detail how they should punish their ‚Äúdisobedient‚Äù wives, while not a single text exclusively tells women what they should do with unfaithful husbands. It‚Äôs about taking pride in not being allowed to vote, let alone lead your nations, and about finally being allowed to ride a goddamn bicycle ‚Äì under a mehram‚Äôs supervision ‚Äì in the year 2013 AD.

The #MuslimahPride jihad will be written down in history as the moment where Muslimaat made it clear to the world that no one should protest on their behalf, half-naked or otherwise. Thank you, dear Muslimaat, for saving the rest of the world‚Äôs time by clarifying that you‚Äôre fine living in the 7th century AD, and no one should push you towards the enlightened times, regardless of whether they have clothes on or not. Thank you for being a source of inspiration and an illuminating example for everyone. We all know that you have what it takes to transform the plight of the women and change the dynamics of the world, as long as you are back home before sunset.

More power to you.

PS: I hope being addressed as ‚Äòdear‚Äô does not land you in trouble with your oversensitive male guardians.

Yours thankfully,

"Hey! Guess what? I don't own any of the characters! Wow! Isn't that amazing?

Hemolele walked into her new school with a small amount of nervousness. It was small because she was almost never nervous, being strong of heart. Hemolele walked through the new hallways and found her classroom 3-A.

As she walked into the room her bright blue shimmering orbs gazed about the room. With a single glance she took in every detail. The teacher was a smiling Japanese man and all of the students were amazingly beautiful. Hemolele knew she would fit right in.

All of the students jaws dropped upon seeing such a vision of loveliness, despite the horrible yellow dress, come through their ordinary classroom door. Before Hemolele could take a step everyone was calling out to have her sit next to them.

Hemolele put her hand gracefully up to her mouth in indecision. A moment later she was saved from her indecision from a charming prince.

""My beautiful princess, will you do me the honor of sitting next to me in class today?"" The blonde Prince Charming enquired gracefully.

Hemolele gave the most perfect of graceful nods as she allowed her Prince Charming to lead her to a seat. As class started and the assignments were given Hemolele realized she must be in the wrong class.

She raised her hand and upon being called on declared ""Sir, I believe I am in the wrong class.""

The teacher blinked his eyes at her over his glasses before asking ""Why do you believe this?""

Hemolele smiled a beautifully shining smile ""Because, I learned all of this coursework when I was but a small child. It is much too easy for my advanced mind.""

Hemolele stopped a groan, because a groan shows imperfection, as the teacher's jaw dropped open and he stated rather dumbly ""Advanced Mind?""

""Yes, my advanced mind. I was being tutored at home in Hawaii. My family is full Hawaiian, except my father, who gave me my beautiful baby blue eyes. When I heard of this school I did some research and then applied for it. I applied because I learned that it is the best private school in the entire world. Yet it appears my research was incorrect, which is impossible, because I already know everything you are teaching."" Hemolele sat back and smiled kindly at the poor confused teacher, after all, one must always be kind to those below you.

The teacher seemed completely lost at her words until some black-haired boy with glasses suggested that the headmaster's son show her to the headmaster's office so everything could be cleared up. The teacher hastily agreed and Hemolele soon found herself alone with her Prince Charming as they wandered the hallways. Honestly, Hemolele didn't need her Prince Charming to show her where the headmaster's office was. She had memorized the floor plan of the school when she was still researching the school.

Hemolele cast a shy glance towards her Prince Charming. He was so gorgeous, and obviously not pure Japanese, part of her wondered what the other part was, but the rest didn't care. Hemolele decided to declare her instant, unbelievable, and perfect love for her Prince Charming.

Hemolele stopped walking and reached out to grab her Prince Charming's arm, allowing her eyes to fall to the ground gracefully. They stood frozen in this spot for a moment before Hemolele finally spoke. ""I love you! I've loved you since the moment I first saw you. You are my prince charming."" Hemolele declared quite dramatically.

Her Prince Charming slowly turned around. Hemolele allowed her shimmering stunning sapphire eyes to stare into his and she let a question rise to the top of her shimmering orbs. Did he love her back?

She knew, down to the bottom of her perfect soul, that he was the one for her. He was made for her. So he had to be the one for her right? He had to have been made for her, otherwise she would just die.

""You love me? Awww! That's so sweet!"" Her Prince Charming declared beautifully as he gave her a quick hug before starting to walk off again.

Before she could look up she heard words come out of her Prince Charming's ruby lips. ""I'm sorry princess, but I can't love you. My heart belongs to another."" Her Prince Charming somehow mistook the look on her face. ""Yes, I know it's hard to believe. But I love Haruhi with all my heart!""

Just as Hemolele was about to burst into tears and run off her Prince Charming began to murmur to himself. ""Yes, I love Haruhi with all my heart. Probably because Hatori Bisco likes me more than anyone else in the Host Club, so I got the girl. I wonder if I was made for Haruhi or if she was made for me? Though I guess, naturally, she would be better off with Hikaru or Kyoya in terms of personality; since her faults line up better with theirs.""

Most of what he said was gibberish, but the last line was clear to her. Hemolele could not help her perfect self, she had to interject there. ""What do you mean her faults? You are a perfect prince charming, how can you love someone with faults? You should love someone like me!""

Her Prince Charming looked at her and blinked several times. ""Love someone with faults? I love her BECAUSE of her faults.""

Hemolele felt panic rising in her chest. ""Because of her faults? That cannot be! Faults are a weakness! They will destroy you!""

Her Prince Charming began looking at her like she was insane. ""Faults are not a weakness; they only make us stronger and better. This is why no one could ever love you, though it pains me to say it.""

Panic was no longer rising in Hemolele's chest, it was bubbling over. ""What do you mean no one could ever love me? I'm perfect! Perfect people get loved the most! Haven't you read the fairy tales?""

Her Prince Charming smiled softly at her with sad eyes. ""Perfect people in fairy tales get the prize, that's true. But life is not a fairy tale and you are not truly perfect.""

Panic began gushing all through Hemolele's chest. ""What do you mean I'm not truly perfect? Everything I try I do perfectly. Everyone likes me, admires me, and loves me. I even look perfect, how can I not be perfect?""

Now her Prince Charming smiled miserably as he reached out and ran a soft finger down her jawline. ""Because in your own perfection, you have a glaring flaw, you are a Mary Sue. Because you are perfect you have the worst fault of all.""

Panic ran throughout Hemolele's entire body as she began to hyperventilate. The words that her Prince Charming said began sinking through her, mixing with the panic. As soon as the words touched her heart Hemolele knew it was over. She exploded on the spot.

Tamaki stood there and watched the poor Mary Sue disintegrate. He hated having to do that, he wished people would stop giving birth to Mary Sues. Since all they truly caused was pain. Tamaki shook his head softly and went back to class.

Everyone seemed to have forgotten about the poor Mary Sue, except Kyoya. ""So, did you deal with her like the others?""

Tamaki nodded sadly ""Yes, and it hurt just as much this time as it did the first time.""

Kyoya smiled softly at his best friend and patted him on the shoulder. ""I know, but remember; if you don't do that then they will take over and destroy our world. Which would destroy Haruhi, since Hatori Bisco doesn't allow villains you would eventually end up with the Mary Sue and Haruhi would disappear from the story.""

Tamaki nodded as he gave Kyoya a heartrending look. ""I just wish people wouldn't try and force unwanted people on us. We're happy with the status quo. Haruhi and I are deliriously happy and I have my entire family back. I just wish people would leave it at that.""

Kyoya nodded sagely before saying, to no one in particular. ""Do you hear that? Stop sending us Mary Sues, you're destroying Tamaki. He wants Haruhi, hell, I want Haruhi, we all want her. We don't want your Mary Sues."" Kyoya then adjusts his glasses before going back to his assignment.

Author's Note: So I came up with this as I was reading an article on trolls. Which got me thinking (dunno why) about how annoying all the stories are that are just chock full of Mary Sues. So here's my parody of a Mary Sue story. Hemolele actually means perfect in Hawaiian... In case you're wondering, the reason Mary Sue never calls anyone by name is because she can't. She's so wrapped up in being perfect that she can't see the world around her.

Please review and let me know what you think! This is my first time writing a parody of any sort and I'd love to know your thoughts on it.

Good day to you, sir. It seems a shame that you have taken this attitude, after all, I did welcome you nicely in the hope that you might want to contribute constructively to this encyclopedia. Wikipedia isn't a spoof website, it's an encyclopedia, so articles that you think are amusing are not nessesarily seen as funny by others. It wasn't actually me that deleted it, I merely flagged it up as being non-encyclopedic and another editor thought the same. Westenders is a nice idea for a parody soap opera, and that sort of thing might be seen as quite comical on a website such as Uncyclopedia, which is as spoof encyclopedia, thus if you want to write less serious entries that may be the place to go.

"The addition of the infamous chicken sandwich to Popeyes nationwide menu on Aug. 12 has sparked a debate on whether it measures up or surpasses Chick-fil-A‚Äôs celebrated chicken sandwich. We‚Äôre here for it. Disclaimer: this comparative analysis pertains solely to the spicy chicken sandwiches. For a review of the classic chicken sandwiches, please see psychopaths anonymous.

The Popeyes spicy chicken sandwich was a whooping $4.39 by itself and came nestled inside a wrapper oddly similar to Chick-fil-A‚Äôs, but also with a piece of parchment paper wrapped around it for an easy, ready-to-eat experience. In contrast, the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich came wrapped in the traditional Chick-fil-A aluminum wrapper and was $4.23 by itself.

The Popeyes sandwich is made up of two fluffy brioche buns between the large, crispy piece of fried chicken filet that‚Äôs accompanied by two large slices of pickles and mayo. The chicken was crunchy, juicy and had that traditional taste of Popeyes chicken that does not necessitate the compliment of a sauce. The chicken was not as spicy as I‚Äôd hoped, but the crispiness made up for it.

In contrast, the Chick-fil-A spicy chicken sandwich was made up of two flat brioche buns, a fried chicken filet, two slices of pickles and no sauce. I poured Chick-fil-A sauce on my sandwich (if you‚Äôre not doing this, you‚Äôre not eating it right). It had the traditional taste of a Chick-fil-A sandwich ‚Äì juicy, not as crunchy and with the marvelous taste of Chick-fil-A sauce that makes it taste like nuggets and BBQ at the same time.

Both sandwiches are delicious in their own respect. The Popeyes sandwich was substantially larger, with a bigger diameter, larger chicken filet and much fluffier buns. While the chicken was not as spicy, it was crispy and seasoned just right with the nice touch of mayo. Chick-fil-A‚Äôs sandwich is not as seasoned but spicier, though it is elevated by the magical Chick-fil-A sauce.

If I had to choose between the two, I prefer the Popeyes sandwich. It was more filling and does not require the overload of sauce to taste great. However, tasting the delectable, traditional Popeyes chicken made me miss the biscuit and fries, which made me think how heavenly it‚Äôd be if Popeyes made XL biscuits just for the chicken sandwiches instead of buns and also put fries inside. You hear me, Popeyes?

While there are political upsides to supporting one Louisiana-based franchise and not the Georgia-based one that makes donations to anti-LGBTQ organizations, the Popeyes sandwich is superior solely based on taste and more bang for your buck. Chick-fil-A does have the undisputed upper hand when it comes to customer service, though. And that‚Äôs the tea.",1,en,1

"In Vancouver there were two ways it was logically and definitively concluded that supply was not a major contributing factor.

The first way was to notice that house prices had reached dozens of times the average annual local salary. See, there is no way house prices can get that high without an external source of money flooding in, since banks do not hand out mortgages to workers for dozens of times their annual salary. Which is to say that the massive demand was not coming from local workers. In Vancouver's case it was coming from overseas money, from Hong Kong and, later, from mainland China, mainly. No ""supply"" can quench that.

The second way was to notice, wow, how many houses and condominiums were empty! They were bought and paid for, cash down, but nobody lived in them!

"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Abortion is a hot topic in Texas, with both sides vocal in their beliefs

A female politician in Texas is taking an unusual swipe at what she sees as restrictive abortion laws by targeting men - more precisely male masturbation.

Her unlikely draft law has a simple aim, she says - to protect unborn children everywhere.

Which is why it wants all ""emissions outside of a woman's vagina, or created outside of a health or medical facility"" to carry a $100 (¬£81) fine.

If a man made such an emission it would ""be considered an act against an unborn child"".

If it sounds like something out of a dystopian novel, that is because it is meant to.

'If it's good for the goose...'

Jessica Farrar, a Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives, submitted House Bill number 4260 last week. She knows it will never become law. Indeed, it is unlikely to make it far at all.

But she argues it is no more extreme than the restrictions put on women by the state of Texas when it comes to choosing whether or not to end their pregnancy.

The last straw for her came with the most recent in a string of proposed bills, which she saw as chipping away at women's rights.

The latest wanted to force women to choose whether to bury or cremate the embryonic remains of either a miscarriage or abortion.

During a hearing for the bill last August, state Senator Don Huffines said: ""For far too long, Texas has allowed the most innocent among us to be thrown out with the daily waste.""

Ms Farrar decided to put a different spin on this belief.

""It got me thinking, maybe what's good for the goose is good for the gander,"" Ms Farrar told the BBC. ""If we are taking these measures because of the sanctity of life, well, we just cannot waste any seed.""

But her critics were not impressed. ""Plain stupid,"" said one on Twitter, saying that only a fertilised embryo needs protecting, and asking if she would also use the law on menstruating women.

""Life begins at conception,"" Mr Huffines had said.

Image copyright Jessica Farrar Image caption Jessica Farrar has submitted a bill on male reproductive rights to highlight how she sees women's rights being undermined

Texas has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the US - even though the Supreme Court overturned a 2014 ban on drug-induced abortions after seven weeks last year.

The restrictions mean clinics providing abortions are few and far between. According to the Texas Tribune, there were 19 abortion clinics in June 2016, the vast majority of them concentrated in urban areas.

It has left 95% of counties within Texas's expansive borders without a clinic. In the 885km (550 miles) between San Antonio and El Paso - the same distance as between Penzance and Edinburgh - there are no abortion clinics.

Ms Farrar also speaks angrily of women forced to sit and listen to a lecture on the moral implications of abortion, and look at images of foetuses when they seek terminations. They also undergo an intrusive vaginal ultrasound to hear the baby's heartbeat, and receive warnings of abortion being linked to breast cancer, even though this claim has been disproved.

""It is clear this is about manipulation,"" said Ms Farrar, whose bill suggests a male equivalent for each step, including a ""digital rectal exam"".

""As if every woman has not thought about this [abortion]. The fact is, only she knows what has happened in her life,"" she said.

Texas-based group New Wave Feminists insists it wants to support women, but believes a foetus has rights too.

""Many would say that the foetus is actually the most vulnerable member of the human family and yet, because it is smaller, weaker, and can't tell us to stop, we've decided it's okay to dispose of it however we see fit,"" the organisation says.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Anti-abortion rally energised by Trump

Texan women are not alone in facing an increase in legislation over abortion.

Anti-abortion activists and their supporters have become emboldened as Donald Trump's White House shifts away from the pro-choice stance of the Obama years.

A slew of new restrictions has been proposed by lawmakers across the country. Among them, one which would force women in Oklahoma to get permission from their sexual partner to allow them to have an abortion.

Human incubators

The man who proposed that bill, which passed its first reading in February, described a pregnant woman as a ""host"" for her unborn child. The idea is something Ms Farrar fears in her own state.

""We are dealing with more measures being proposed which would treat the woman as an incubator,"" said the Houston native, who was first elected to the Texas House in 1994.

Already, the right to life of an unborn child overrules a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order in Texas for women who are pregnant.

A DNR order would normally mean medical staff do not attempt to bring a patient back to life if they stop breathing or their heart stops, because of the damage already done to the patient.

Now, new proposed legislation would force women to carry an unviable foetus to term if it is discovered after 20 weeks, while another could even prevent a doctor telling a family of their baby's condition if he feels they may choose an abortion.

Elizabeth Graham, director of anti-abortion organisation, Texas Right to Life, defends preserving the life of the foetus.

""Current provisions singling out disabled preborn children for death are not only embarrassing for the state but morally unconscionable.""

Image copyright AP Image caption Ms Farrar hopes the bill will make people sit up and think about Texas's strict laws

Ms Farrar argues that more pressing issues need to be addressed, like the fact Texas has the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world.

""I think the reason we are where we are is because people have tolerated these things,"" she added. ""I'm hoping my bill will wake people up.""",1,en,1

Dang, time for new straps! Glass replacement is free thru my insurance, haven't had to use it yet though.

Who do you have if you don't mine me asking? It would've been more but I also have mechanical break down and knocked off 1/2 of the bill. That's my deductible. That breakdown stuff has saved me alot of dough that's for sure.

That sucks man. Edit that word out now! I've had far heavier things strapped in loosely and they never moved even when i'm out wheelin'....you sure you properly secured that thing?

yep. They snapped like dried out twiggs. They were old too. That's another pair that I worn out. I have to use them because that is who my insurance company called. They tried another local company but they wanted a shade under $800.00 bucks. We said hell no to that.

I would delete the comment about what you called her or your asking for a ban as there are female members on here.

I'm also troubled when one has a hard ideology about raising or cutting taxes, as I belief each situation needs to be addressed individually to find what is best. I don't think one can say all options need to be considered and then in the next sentence remove an the option of raising taxes. 

My fear is that to leave social security to the swings of the stock market makes it too vulnerable; that it removes the ""security"" from ""social security. This is a risk I am not willing to take.

"How is Commercial Property Rent Calculated?

If you are looking to lease a property for commercial reasons, it is wise to consult with your lawyers & solicitors well before you sign anything. They can ensure that the lease is drawn up properly so that you know exactly what you will have to pay. And they can add clauses to protect you from many potential problems. So how exactly is rent for a commercial property calculated? Several things are taken into consideration.

The location is a prime consideration. When the locations is in a place where there are many potential customers, e.g. a mall, then more will be added to that square metre charge.

The condition of the building is also taken into consideration. A building that is run-down, unpainted or with paint peeling, the roof leaks or the floor covering is old and dirty would be much cheaper than a property that is spick and span ‚Äì for the reason that no one would really want the former. It would cost a fortune to fix up.

Nearby services and surrounding tenants all have a small part to play in the amount of rent charged for such premises. More is better for business so the price goes up, less is not so good for business so the price will be dropped.

If you want to know whether the rental price your landlord has charged you is fair you need to do your research. In fact, this should have been done before you signed, but it is never too late. The lease has an end date and you can renegotiate, right? So on to that research.

Estate agents are your friends. A real estate agent usually knows a great deal about business rentals since they frequently find them for business people. They get to know what the going rental rate is in a particular location and will be happy to discuss it with you.

You can go online and look at similar properties to yours. Remember they should be similar in size, location and amenities as well as in good repair. The rental price will usually be plainly in sight. If it‚Äôs not, shoot them an email and inquire about it. Regular research will soon make you familiar with the price of rent in different areas.

Ask other tenants in the area what they are paying. Most will be happy to discuss it with you, especially if they think they are being ripped off.

Once you know for sure that you are paying too much you‚Äôll be able to watch your step more carefully next time the lease is due for renewal.",1,en,1

A year ago, during my residency at the Museum of Arts and Design, I started a new solo project that will soon debut at the Leslie-Lohman Museum.

"Building high-quality assay libraries for targeted analysis of SWATH MS data.
Targeted proteomics by selected/multiple reaction monitoring (S/MRM) or, on a larger scale, by SWATH (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra) MS (mass spectrometry) typically relies on spectral reference libraries for peptide identification. Quality and coverage of these libraries are therefore of crucial importance for the performance of the methods. Here we present a detailed protocol that has been successfully used to build high-quality, extensive reference libraries supporting targeted proteomics by SWATH MS. We describe each step of the process, including data acquisition by discovery proteomics, assertion of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), generation of consensus spectra and compilation of MS coordinates that uniquely define each targeted peptide. Crucial steps such as false discovery rate (FDR) control, retention time normalization and handling of post-translationally modified peptides are detailed. Finally, we show how to use the library to extract SWATH data with the open-source software Skyline. The protocol takes 2-3 d to complete, depending on the extent of the library and the computational resources available.",0,en,0

"It‚Äôs been a heady two weeks for right-wing Christian evangelicals. Never before has a president of the United States ‚Äî not Reagan or either of the Bushes ‚Äî delivered so much of their agenda in such short order as Donald Trump has just done. He capped off his string of early valentines to the religious right with the announcement of a Supreme Court nominee who is poised to revoke the rights of women, further tear down the ‚Äúwall‚Äù between church and state and open wider the doors for big monied interests to buy the political system they want.

The right-wing press was breathless in its praise for 49-year-old Judge Neil Gorsuch, named by Trump on Tuesday night to ascend to the high court with the seat vacated by the death of Antonin Scalia, who was a ferocious opponent of reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights and significant remedial measures for ensuring civil liberties for African-Americans. Yet religious-minded conservatives may come to love their new man even more than the lionized Scalia: The New York Times places Gorsuch to Scalia‚Äôs right.

Trump had promised he would appoint a justice who would overturn Roe v. Wade. Evidence from Gorsuch‚Äôs record ‚Äî such as his call for a second look at a 10th circuit decision that blocked the state of Utah from defunding Planned Parenthood ‚Äî suggests where his sympathies are. At the very least, he can be counted on to rule in the right‚Äôs favor in cases designed to create barriers to obtaining contraceptives or an abortion.

During the 2016 campaign, pundits were often incredulous at the sight of religious-right leaders at the side of the thrice-married, biblically ignorant, philandering, ethically challenged businessman-turned-politician ‚Äî one whose blatant and coarsely stated misogyny, whose braggadocio about sexually harassing women, whose treatment of women as property and objects of derision, could not deter them from joining his quest. After the election, commentators puzzled over the 81 percent of white evangelical voters who cast their ballots for Trump, despite ample evidence of his questionable, decidedly unchristian business practices and cheating of workers and contractors. Not even the scandal of his Trump University grift kept them away from him.

The attraction is now apparent: power.

The biggest winners

In fairness, it must be said that in the opening days of his presidency, Trump served up a series of executive orders and memoranda designed to please various constituencies in his coalition. The white nationalists would be getting their wall. The oilmen would get their pipeline. The Islamophobes would get their Muslim ban. The Obama-haters would find satisfaction in an order to purge affordable health care from the books. But the religious right would get pretty much everything it wanted ‚Äî all of the above and more.

For his opening gambit in the week following his inauguration, Trump not only reinstated restrictions on the kinds of health care global aid groups receiving U.S. funding are permitted to deliver to women around the world, he applied those restrictions to a far greater range of programs and organizations than the Bush version of the regulations known as the global gag rule or Mexico City policy ‚Äî impacting 15 times the amount of aid dollars, by one estimate. At issue is aid to any organization that would dare to inform women that abortion is one option for ending a pregnancy. ‚ÄúIn other words, NGOs that distribute bed nets for malaria, provide childhood vaccines, support early childhood nutrition and brain development, run HIV programs, fight ebola or Zika and much more, must now certify their compliance with the Global Gag Rule or risk losing U.S. funds,‚Äù wrote Mark Leon Goldberg at UN Dispatch. In other words, people (mostly women) will likely die because of this rule.

With Trump‚Äôs beefed-up version of the gag-rule policy first instituted by Ronald Reagan and its timing as one of his first orders of business, the president displayed his fealty to those among the religious right who turned out the vote for him, teeing up the measure for Vice President Mike Pence to bray about from the stage of the Jan. 23 March for Life rally, an annual exercise by Catholic organizations and schools marking the court‚Äôs Roe decision.

The vice president‚Äôs address at the rally was the first time one of the two elected leaders of the executive branch ever took that stage. Anna Thomas, a teacher from Tuckahoe, New York, told USA Today, ‚ÄúWe still need as voters to hold Trump‚Äôs feet to the fire, but I feel like we‚Äôve got an ally there [in Pence] and that feels like a first in my lifetime.‚Äù Pence‚Äôs hardline anti-choice credentials, both during his tenure in Congress and as governor of Indiana, make him a hero to the movement.

The day before the march, Cardinal Timothy Dolan appeared on the daily radio program of Breitbart News, dubbed the ‚Äúplatform for the alt-right‚Äù by former CEO Steve Bannon, the advocate of white nationalism who now serves as chief White House strategist. Dolan, who would the next day address the March for Life, was feeling pretty cheery about the Trump administration, breezily discussing politics on a website known for promoting Islamophobia, homophobia, misogyny and attacks on African-American civil rights leaders. Not to mention its reputation as an organizing tool of the Trump campaign.

Advertisement:

Speaking of the reinstated gag rule to Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, Dolan framed it as a boon to Catholic Relief Services, falsely claiming that the Obama administration had required the aid group to dispense ‚Äúabortifacients.‚Äù (Defying scientific evidence, anti-choice advocates routinely and inaccurately describe such forms of contraception as IUDs and morning-after pills as forms of abortion.)

‚ÄúThanks be to God,‚Äù Dolan said, ‚Äúnow that straightjacket has been removed from the extraordinarily effective religious relief organizations in international aid. So this is lookin‚Äô good, Alex, and we look for even better things to come. We want to keep our eye on the appointment of the Supreme Court justice, we want to keep our eye on the reform of the Affordable Care Act to make sure that the hideous parts of it that many people, like the bishops of the United States, have pointed to that need to be cleansed.‚Äù The bishops have long protested the ACA‚Äôs mandate that employer-based health care plans provide no-copay prescription contraception to subscribers, and now are poised to see a new Supreme Court justice who agrees with them.

Priority for Christians

In their quest to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Catholic bishops long ago allied with right-wing evangelical and fundamentalist Protestants, to whom Trump reached out to in a White House interview with David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) on Jan. 25.

Seated in the opulent Blue Room six days before Tuesday night‚Äôs announcement of his selection of Gorsuch, Trump told Brody that he believed the CBN audience would be pleased. ‚ÄúI think evangelicals ‚Äî Christians ‚Äî will love my pick,‚Äù the president said. (At the March for Life, Pence promised the crowd of tens of thousands that Trump ‚Äúwill announce a Supreme Court nominee who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia.‚Äù)

The day of the March for Life, Trump issued the executive order that brought protesters to airports and streets around the country: a halt to admitting travelers to the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries, including refugees from Syria, whose citizens are trapped in a war known for wide-scale crimes against humanity. While the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement opposing the order, certain right-wing evangelical groups, such as the Family Research Council, have featured anti-Muslim speakers at their conferences, and complained that Christians persecuted in Islamic countries were abetted by the Obama administration.

While some evangelical leaders have condemned Trump‚Äôs policy, the Atlantic‚Äôs Emma Green speculates that those are not the leaders the rank-and-file listen to and do not share their views. ‚ÄúEven if they think an open refugee policy is in line with the teachings of Christianity,‚Äù she writes, ‚Äúlay Americans don‚Äôt necessarily feel the same way.‚Äù

Religious figures who have expressed support for the ban include Ralph Reed, who spearheaded voter-turnout efforts in the evangelical community for Trump, and Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham and leader of the charity Samaritan‚Äôs Purse, who delivered a prayer from the inaugural podium.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a biblical command for the country to let everyone in who wants to come, that‚Äôs not a Bible issue,‚Äù Graham told the Huffington Post. In an interview with The Washington Post, Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and the political strategist who spearheaded voter turnout efforts for Trump among right-wing evangelicals, called the executive order ‚Äúan entirely prudent move.‚Äù

In a Jan. 20 interview with the Christian Times, FRC‚Äôs Tony Perkins, who was late aboard the Trump train, expressed doubts about Rex Tillerson, Trump‚Äôs pick to lead the State Department, for insufficient defense of the religious-right agenda.

Advertisement:

‚ÄúWe know that Christians are suffering globally as a result of our State Department‚Äôs misplaced priorities. That cannot continue. It‚Äôs going to require a leader who is willing to be criticized, who is willing to be a change agent. I just don‚Äôt know that is him,‚Äù Perkins told reporter Jardine Malado.

Just days later, Trump said to CBN‚Äôs Brody that in the ‚Äúextreme vetting‚Äù to be set in motion as a result of the order, persecuted Christians seeking asylum would be given priority over other persecuted people ‚Äî a move whose constitutionality is highly questionable.

‚ÄúWe are going to help them,‚Äù Trump told Brody. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair ‚Äî everybody was persecuted in all fairness ‚Äî but they were chopping off the heads of everybody, but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair.‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs assertion that Christians have a harder time winning asylum in the United States than do Muslims is rated by PolitiFact as false.

A ""time of incredible promise""

At the March for Life, Vice President Pence wasn‚Äôt the only member of Trump‚Äôs administration to rally the troops. Presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway, a staple of the Sunday morning talk show circuit, was greeted with cheers when she introduced herself as ‚Äúa mother, a wife, a Catholic and counselor to the president of the United States.‚Äù Evident in her rhetoric was a reframing of the anti-choice movement: ‚ÄúThis is a time of incredible promise for the pro-life, pro-adoption movement.‚Äù Throughout the event, women facing unwanted pregnancies were exhorted to give birth for the benefit of couples seeking to adopt.

March for Life leader Jeanne Mancini served up this nugget: ‚ÄúDid you know that Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, was adopted? Can you imagine how different our lives would be if we didn‚Äôt have our iPhones?‚Äù

She neglected to mention that under a refugee ban such as the one instituted by Trump, Steve Jobs would never have been born. His birth father is a Muslim from Syria who met Jobs‚Äô birth mother in Wisconsin.

Nonetheless, CBN‚Äôs David Brody was jazzed by Trump‚Äôs first week, using his blog to tick off all of the policies and initiative the new president had set in motion as causes for celebration, writing in a Jan. 26 post:

""The reality is Donald Trump would not have the title of 'president' if it were not for evangelical voters. And so far, he‚Äôs off to a promising start. Just look at his first week alone:

‚Äî Reinstating the pro-life Mexico City policy

‚Äî Making good on a plethora of campaign promises

‚Äî Shaking up the press briefing room (where CBN and others are now a part of the healthy give and take)

‚Äî A record number of evangelical pastors praying in the name of Jesus at the inauguration

‚Äî Trump himself invoking God‚Äôs help for America

‚Äî And let‚Äôs not forget about many members of his Cabinet who are born-again believers. That‚Äôs just in one week.""

Add to that list Trump‚Äôs promise last week that his administration would ‚Äútotally destroy‚Äù a law banning political activity by churches and the announcement that Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Liberty University and the son of late televangelist and Moral Majority co-founder Jerry Falwell, will be heading up a new education task force for the president. A Liberty University spokesman told USA Today on Wednesday that Falwell, an early Trump supporter, agreed to head up the task force after declining to be Trump‚Äôs nominee for education secretary. Trump instead chose Betsy DeVos, another member of the right-wing Christian community.

"1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to the financial vehicle known as the variable annuity contract. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system for and method of variable annuity contract administration.
2. Description of the Prior Art
When an individual retires and no longer collects a salary, he or she needs a way to be able to maintain the same quality of living as he or she enjoyed prior to retirement. Through the purchase of annuity contracts, individuals are provided with an opportunity to meet their retirement needs. As those of ordinary skill in the art know, an annuity is an insurance contract issued by an insurance company whereby the contractowner can obtain future payments based on the value at retirement of amounts paid into the annuity by the contractowner. Depending upon the payout option chosen, this stream of payments can be for life, for life with a period certain, for a certain period of time, etc. There are many payout options available with annuities.
There are generally two types of individual annuities, fixed and variable. With a fixed annuity, interest will accrue on monies paid in by the contractowner at a rate set by the insurance company during the accumulation phase. Taxes are deferred on the accumulated interest and annuity payout options are available. With a variable annuity, the contractowner can make deposits into a variety of mutual fund subaccounts offered through the annuity, defer the taxes on income and gains from these funds, and convert the funds to an income stream for the rest of the contractowner's lifetime. In recent years, the variable annuity has become the more popular type of annuity contract.
A variable annuity contract has two phases. The first phase of the contract is the accumulation phase of the contract. The second phase of the contract is the payout phase of the contract. During the accumulation phase of a variable annuity, deposits can typically be made regularly or at the discretion of the contractowner and directed into any number of the underlying mutual fund subaccounts. Further, these balances can be moved from one fund to another at the discretion of the contractowner. Generally, a death benefit is also provided which pays the greater of the accumulation value of the contract or the total premiums paid into the contract less any withdrawals taken. There are also other, more liberal, death benefits in many contracts.
In the payout phase, the contractowner has a choice of a number of different payout options. For example, the payout may be a life annuity with a guaranteed period or a life annuity with period certain. The various payout options protect the contractowner from the adverse consequences of living too long and outliving his or her money.
As the variable annuity has evolved and as variable annuities have become more popular, there have been many innovations in this area. Various types of death benefits, living benefits, guaranteed minimum income benefits, bonus investment credits for the contractowners at issue, disability benefits, etc., have been developed. In the current variable annuity contract marketplace, there are many different variable annuity contracts with many different features, and it is expected that there will continue to be many innovations in the variable annuity field and many more additional product features in the future.
A recent innovation in the field of variable annuities has been a bonus investment credit. A bonus investment credit is money that is paid into the annuity by the insurance company which issues the annuity contract at the time premium payments are made. The bonus investment credit is usually some percent of the premium that is paid into the contract by the contractowner. For example, with a 3% bonus investment credit, if a deposit of $100,000 is made by the contractowner, an additional $3,000 would be credited by the insurance company to the contract. The bonus investment credit has proved in the marketplace to be a valuable feature to potential contractowners. However, the implementation of the bonus investment credit in an annuity contract has typically resulted in higher penalties for withdrawals of money from the annuity by the contractowner.
Another area which has evolved in the variable annuity marketplace is the payment of commissions to distributors who sell variable annuities. Commissions can be paid to distributors up-front on premium deposits, partially up-front and partially in the renewal years, or as asset-based compensation. Asset-based compensation is defined as compensation which is paid as a percentage of the accumulated value of the contract. However, in the first year, the compensation will be paid as a percentage of the premium paid. This is because during the first year the premium has not had time to accumulate significantly and thus there will be no substantial difference between the premium paid and the assets of the contract.
From the contractowner's point of view, assuming that the compensation is actuarially equivalent, annuities that pay asset-based compensation to distributors are generally better. For example, assume that the commission is paid up-front and that there is no further compensation forthcoming from the contract to the distributor. In that situation, the distributor might try to convince the contractowner to move the money that is in his or her current annuity contract to a different annuity contract, thereby entitling the distributor to another up-front commission payment. This would often not be in the best interests of the contractowner as the contractowner would have a new set of withdrawal charges with the new contract.
With respect to commissions, annuities can generally be categorized into two classes: (1) those annuities which pay commissions to distributors and (2) those annuities which do not pay commissions and are sold directly to contractowners through 800 numbers, over the Internet, etc. While, in general, annuities that do not pay commissions are cheaper for the contractowner, the contractowner of the annuity that pays commissions receives service and guidance from the distributor and thereby, theoretically speaking, is able to make better informed decisions concerning the variable annuity and his or her retirement needs.
Bonus investment credits have been particularly popular with prospective contractowners with both the class of annuities that pays commissions and the class of annuities that does not pay commissions. Within the class of annuities that pays commissions, there are a number of annuities that pay a bonus investment credit. However, currently all of these annuities have withdrawal charge percentages that are higher than the bonus investment credit percentage that is provided to the contractowner and that are considered to be high in the annuity marketplace.
Withdrawal charges are a feature of variable annuities that should be closely examined by a prospective contractowner. Withdrawal charges are a percentage of the amount withdrawn and apply for a certain period of time. Significant penalties for withdrawals and long periods of time for which withdrawal penalties apply are features of variable annuity contracts which can limit the flexibility of the contractowner. For example, in the case of a variable annuity that has a bonus investment credit and that pays commissions, typical withdrawal charges would range from 6% to 9% of the amount withdrawn in the first year and would apply for a period from six to ten years. The withdrawal charges would decrease over the period of time during which charges apply.
Although there are many different types of variable annuity contracts in the marketplace, there has not been a variable annuity contract designed to pay a bonus investment credit to the contractowner where (1) the withdrawal charge percentages in all contract years are less than the bonus investment credit percentage and (2) commissions are paid to distributors. Currently, variable annuity contracts that pay commissions and have a bonus investment credit also have withdrawal charge percentages that are significantly greater than the bonus investment credit percentage. There are also commission-paying variable annuity contracts that have lower withdrawal charges but that do not have a bonus investment credit. Neither of these options would be as attractive to a prospective contractowner as a variable annuity that includes both a bonus investment credit and withdrawal charges which are not greater than the bonus investment credit.
It is clear from the foregoing discussion that variable annuity contracts are complex insurance vehicles. Because of this complexity, it is desirable to provide a system and method which can be used to facilitate the administration of variable annuity contracts expeditiously and efficiently. Additionally, because of the large amount of competition among issuers in the variable annuity market, it is desirable to provide a system for and method of administering variable annuity contracts which are more efficient and consumer-oriented than other variable annuity contacts in order to attract more would-be contractowners and thereby gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.",0,en,0

Just my two cents... I was put on stimulants and anti-psychotics around the age of ten, then in my teens i was put on anti-depressants and mood stabilizers. I stopped taking all those things back in 2010, and since 2012 i've been using Ayahuasca on and off, and i truly feel like had i not been put on those pharma drugs and could've instead taken Shrooms or Ayahuasca, i would've turned out much better. Plus with Ayahuasca, the DMT in it is natural to the Human body, and isn't anything to worry about health wise. Shrooms, i'm not sure how they would go but i don't imagine a moderate dosage would cause any negative health issues, if done with the right mindset and setting, and setting not being chaotic for the experiencer, the setting needs to be stable and comfortable.

Maybe not all kids, but some, such as myself (i have Aspergers/HFA) and i find it makes for quite the medicine unlike pharmaceuticals, i think the pharmaceuticals did more damage to my younger self than Ayahuasca would've. Ayahuasca is not like other Psychedelics. Yeah i understand how it resets things and you gotta start over, but i feel it can give oneself some guidance if used properly and not recklessly/immaturely (it's gotta be used responsibly and for the right reasons).

I was 17 for my first entheogenic (had tried hallucinogens before but salvia is meaningless compared to the tryptamines and serotonergic psychs) and I think I was too young. The psychedelic experience is something to be taken very seriously and as a young teenager it is really hard to have the familiarity with your own thinking patterns, mannerisms, and the subconscious as a whole to go through the psychedelic experience responsibly and sanely. I'm not saying I hurt myself taking acid in high school, but if my big phase of psychedelic experimentation came when I was most mature it would/could be so much more meaningful.

I started smoking weed at 14 and tripping at 16 and I turned out fine, for the most part.



But - I wouldn't recommend it for anyone. 12 is way too early. Those are the years when you develop skills that you need in order to live a functional life. Those are the years when you can become insanely good at things in a way that will never come again. Anything that gets in the way is bad. All humans are best off waiting until adulthood before indulging in mind altering substances - alcohol, weed, psychedelics, whatever.



That's what I tell my two boys. My older son is 20 and he just started smoking weed. He's in college and doing well, he's held down a great job since he was 16. He totally has his shit together. My younger son is 16 and he's obsessed with basketball, football and running. It's all the does, all he thinks about. You couldn't pay the kid to smoke weed or trip because he knows it would null out most of his efforts.



Post Extras:



You can't just let a kid manage their own psychiatric medication, even if that medication is mushrooms. Even adults shouldn't self medicate. And older brothers shouldn't do for them it either.



And it's not like this kid is treating a mental illness. This kid is tripping recreationally. There is no possible way that this could be justified as being mentally healthy. That's fucking stupid.

If shrooms are properly grown and dried, they aren't bad for physical health. I've never heard they are bad for kids' development.

But they require some responsibility and prudence. I doubt 12 year old is ready.



And you don't know what will be next, so if there is anything you can do to stop him, better try.

I feel like smoking lots of cannabis could be more detrimental then some occasional shroom trips.



I started smoking around 11 and definitely have noticed some negative effects on my memory and some other things.



All in all it isn't the worst but I think you owe it to your younger brother to at least explain why he should wait and what the benefits will be for his brain.

i took my first shrooms when i was 12, look at me now



im perfectly fine



srsly tho it wasnt that bad, nothign wrong happened, but it wasnt big doses, it was 1-2g with friends and my brother. maybe like 15 times till i was 16



but i understand how a big dose or solo trip could really go sour and have long repercusion on a kid.

"In English, we see the letter i followed by n, and we're in: with our tongues pressed against our palates, we find plenty of room at the inn. But in French, the sound represented by in is pronounced nasally, at the back of the throat, and comes out somewhat like anh. English does not have a sound quite like it, except for a kind of derisive snort that often precedes geddoutahere.

Now we come to the reason that French is known as the language of diplomacy. In France's official documents, as well as uniformly in the French press, Vladimir Putin's last name is spelled Poutine. As a natural result, it is pronounced poo-TEEN, rhyming with our ""routine."" The French undoubtedly know that is not the way he or his compatriots, or even President Bush looking into his soul, pronounce Putin's name. (To head off a torrent of e-mail from Quebec, let me acknowledge that poutine is also French-Canadian comfort food: fried potatoes suffused in cheese and dollops of salty gravy.)

Why the error in transliteration? Official French sources tell me that because the sound that we write as in has no place in French pronunciation, an e has been added to make the sound more amenable to the French tongue, and that's all there is to it. They note -- somewhat stiffly, anticipating the direction of my inquiry -- that they have added a vowel to other names for this purpose. But other, more conspiratorial linguists suggest that the spelling of Putin in English would be pronounced as putain in French -- that is, sounding close to pew-TANH.

Putain, in French, means ""prostitute; whore,"" or in current correctese, ""sexual-services provider."" According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it is the probable source, slightly corrupted, of the U.S. slang term poontang, a derogation of women as a means of sexual gratification. Hence, the rejection of the English spelling of Putin and the switch to Poutine, pronounced poo-TEEN. Small wonder that French arbiters of usage and pronunciation -- perhaps out of commendable delicacy, in the interest of the avoidance of offense and the leers of pundits -- have embraced phony phonetics, unanimously choosing to mispronounce the name of the president of Russia.

ARISE, TRANSLITERATI

In digging up this lecherous speculation, I tripped over a matter of concern to those seriously interested in global communication. For years, the transliterati at the Library of Congress, the British Museum, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names and other scholarly institutions have been breaking their heads over ways to bring order to the somewhat slapdash way we express sounds in different languages. Meanwhile, acting unilaterally, the Russian government has worked out its own plan for handling Russian names on its passports to make life simpler for immigration officials of other nations.",1,en,1

The dilemma for some is that the past, while imperfect, was at least a known quantity while the future is a gigantic question mark. For others -- especially those who were on the crappy end of that imperfect past -- it's far better to roll the dice than to return to good old days that really weren't so good.

I think most of us can feel a sea change coming and there's a palpable anxiety in the zeitgeist because of it. I would bet that the weirdness of this election mostly stems from that anxiety.",0,en,0

"""Leiomyomatoid angiomatous neuroendocrine tumor"" (LANT) of the pituitary reflects idiosyncratic angiogenesis in adenomas of the gonadotroph cell lineage.
Based on a single-case observation, the descriptive label ""leiomyomatoid angiomatous neuroendocrine tumor"" (LANT) has been tentatively applied to what was perceived as a possible novel type of dual-lineage pituitary neoplasm with biphasic architecture. We report on two additional examples of an analogous phenomenon encountered in male patients, aged 59 years (Case 1) and 91 years (Case 2). Both tumors were intra- and suprasellar masses, measuring 5.6 cm √ó 4.4 cm √ó 3.4 cm, and 2.7 cm √ó 2 cm √ó 1.7 cm, respectively. Histologically, Case 1 was an FSH-cell adenoma interwoven by vascularized connective tissue septa that tended to exhibit incremental stages of adventitial overgrowth. The epithelial component of Case 2 corresponded to an LH-cell adenoma, and lay partitioned by a maze of paucicellular to hyalinized vascular axes. Irrespective of architectural variations, perivascular spindle cells exhibited immunopositivity for vimentin, muscular actin, and smooth muscle actin. Conversely, negative results were obtained for CD34, EMA, S100 protein, GFAP, and TTF-1. Ultrastructural study failed to reveal metaplastic cell forms involving transitional features between adenohypophyseal-epithelial and mesenchymal-contractile phenotype. We propose that LANT be regarded as a peculiar reflection of maladaptive angiogenesis in some pituitary adenomas, rather than a genuine hybrid neoplasm. While no mechanistic clue is forthcoming to account for this distinctive pattern, hemodynamic strain through direct arterial - rather than portal - supply of the adenoma's capillary bed may be one such explanatory factor. The apparent predilection of the LANT pattern for macroadenomas of the gonadotroph cell lineage remains unexplained.",0,en,0

Once there, which can take a few days, they are examined by the prison doctor and then, maybe, given the medications their own doctor has prescribed. This can mean as much as a week or two without any medications at all. For a person with, for instance, a heart condition, this can be fatal. For a person with a mental illness, this can cause a psychotic break and quite possibly a suicide attempt.

The closer we get to Christmas, the more obnoxiously in your face Christians are, swelled with Christmas smugness like a tick bloated with blood.

This is why the Christians moved their Jesus b-day to December, to glom on to the already happening festivities in most places around the world. Reason for the season? Try the season was the reason from the beginning, and if there was some thing that wrote nice morals into everyone, then how about tapping into them this season, Christians, and enough with the obnoxiousness. Yeah yeah, we get it, you‚Äôve got a holiday coming.

Nod to The Chaplain for pointing me to the ridiculous opinion article.

Wow, you are really pissed off! The article you linked to oozes and drips with the self-righteous attitude that holier-than-thou Christians will be shoving at us for the next month. There were similar articles last week about Thanksgiving and how terrible atheists must feel about having no one to thank‚Ä¶. ARGH!

Perhaps the best way to enjoy the season will be to turn off the TV (except to watch the football games) and leave the newspapers in their wrapped in their plastic wrappers. On the other hand, it‚Äôs entertaining to read the comments sections of some of these articles ‚Äì the freethinkers are great at egging on the nuts.

There‚Äôs really no analogy you can make to Christians at Christmas. No other group on their special day would either compel you to comply with their holiday or have the audacity to suggest that your joy at that time is magically due to their nutty beliefs. The whole ‚Äúreason for the season‚Äù crap really pisses me off, what with the facts that the season was celebrated LONG before Christianity and the reason for Christmas being celebrated on Dec 25 was to glom onto the already celebratory season!

Look, I get the pushing of Christmas by retailers. That‚Äôs understandable, but all the other shit is simply obnoxious and insulting as well. The rampant ignorance of this clown amplifies the fact that all of this is make believe. Who cares if the facts are correct? ugh

One of the Christian bloggers I followed shouted ‚ÄúMcCarthyism‚Äù when he heard that gays in California were outing businesses whose owners had supported Prop 8. Of course, he was not nearly as upset by Focus on the Family urging its followers not to patronize stores that put ‚ÄúHappy Holidays‚Äù in their windows rather than ‚ÄúMerry Christmas.‚Äù

Both are equally fair. The Christians have the right to not patronize a business for whatever reason, as does anyone else for that business‚Äô position on Prop 8. I don‚Äôt see what the problem is. Surely the Christians and anyone else anti-gay would be inclined to patronize the anti-gay businesses and if they REALLY are the ‚Äúmoral majority‚Äù, what‚Äôs the problem? Why, the ‚Äúouting‚Äù of their positions should create business for them, no? The so-called McCarthyism would be free, positive advertising, right? They should be thanking all those yahoos with their crazy ideas about equal rights.

Of course, if that Biblically fueled anti-gay sentiment is not or nowhere near the majority opinion, then that might be bad, but hey, their god wouldn‚Äôt allow anything bad to happen to them, right? Their businesses couldn‚Äôt possibly be jeopardized for supporting their god‚Äôs will, could they? He wouldn‚Äôt let that happen, would he?

‚Äôtis the season of heightened lunacy and amplified religious nonsense.

It‚Äôs the Jesus Jackhammer. It makes for quite the stocking stuffer. Order now to ensure delivery before X-mas. A nice compliment is the Baby Jesus Buttplug. Operators are standing by, so don‚Äôt delay!

Frankly, there were far worse places I could have gone to in order to visualize the idea of having Christianity shoved down our throats at Christmas. Be thankful this was it. Must be evidence of that Christmas magic tempering my visuals.

Nice post PhillyChief. As soon as Thanksgiving ends, Christmas always seems to begin, if it can even wait until after the Turkey is cut (but sometimes they fuck up and even impose their bullshit on our great American Holiday even while eating the turkey). Grumble!

Ugh christmas! I'm looking foreword to it being over. It really is almost intolerable. It's so in your face. My family gets angry if I say anything negative about it. I haven't quite figured out how to get around christmas yet. Last year I gave money to bums in my families name, that was fun.

"Austin Peace Academy

Austin Peace Academy (APA) is an Islamic school in Austin, Texas, serving PreKindergarten through grade 12. As of 2016, its students originate from 19 nationalities. It opened in 1997 as Peace Elementary School in West Campus, housing PreK-Kindergarten, and moved to current location in 1999. The school received its current name in 2003.

History

The Muslim community in Austin founded Austin Peace Academy to meet the crucial challenge of stimulating the minds of the students who enroll in the school while at the same time enabling them to preserve their Islamic identity, heritage and practices.

Austin Peace Academy was established in 1997 in a small building with about sixteen students as the first Islamic school in Austin. The school was initially named Peace Elementary School. In its inaugural year, the school offered Pre-K to Kindergarten (KG).
In 1997, the school was moved to its current location at 5110 Manor Road.

In 2003, the school was renamed Austin Peace Academy which serves students from Pre-school to 12th grade. The school has a diverse body of students whose parents come from 19 nationalities.

In November 2005, Austin Peace Academy was approved for accreditation candidacy by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).

In April 2007, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) recommended Austin Peace Academy for accreditation. In December 2007, at the SACS annual meetings, Austin Peace Academy received its accreditation.

In 2016, Niche ranked Austin Peace Academy the 2nd best private K-12 school in the Austin area.

2.  If a secular priest--ordained locally for his diocese--appears to be a ""religious"" he has more prestige and influence with the ignorant laity who can't tell the difference.  So secular ordained were made to resemble them in lifestyle and bearing as much as possible without the special education, while keeping them firmly under the control of the local bishop.

"IDLESLee's Palace, Toronto ON, September 17

A mere six months ago, IDLES presented their incredibly potent brand of punk music for the first time at Toronto's Hard Luck Bar. On Monday night, the Bristol, UK-based quintet made their grand return to a sold-out swarm of voracious fans. Upgrading to Lee's Palace was a wise decision, as the band have only grown in popularity since dropping their brilliant sophomore record, Joy as An Act of Resistance.

Kicking off with ""Colossus,"" JAAAOR's powerful opening number, each member joined drummer Jon Beavis on stage one at a time to thunderous responses. Frontman Joe Talbot immediately tossed his microphone stand to the side and wrapped its cord around himself as his distinctive growl filled the room.

IDLES barely stopped to catch their breath before tearing into the thunderously anthemic ""Never Fight a Man with a Perm."" Whether moshing in the centre of the floor or screaming along on the sidelines, the entire audience was slick with sweat and utterly captivated. Talbot didn't even have to sing some of his own lyrics; the crowd did it for him as he swayed his arms like a conductor, shaking his head in awe at the overwhelmingly positive reception.

The love that IDLES' fans share for the Brits is fully reciprocal. ""We're pieces of shit, but you make us feel like magicians,"" Talbot declared. During ""Exeter,"" a handful of audience members joyously clambered on stage to join the band. Mark Bowen and Lee Kiernan passed their guitars off for two of them to shred on and Talbot shared his mic as the song exploded into an endearing jam session.

Performing for just over an hour, IDLES' set list was all killer and no filler. In appropriate celebration of JAAAOR's recent release, they confidently churned out new tracks like ""Love Song,"" ""I'm Scum"" and ""Danny Nedelko"" as if they had been touring them for years rather than a few weeks. Careful not to neglect 2017's Brutalism, ""1049 Gotho"" and ""Mother"" elicited raucous responses from the crowd.

Despite the fact that Kiernan's guitar stopped working during the last couple of songs, the set ended on an exceptionally high note with ""Rottweiler,"" JAAAOR's ferocious closer. IDLES' live show is a manifestation of their core mantra: all is love.",1,en,1

And then they need to act in accordance with those values and principles.

The human society is saying we should not mass kill cats, but the same humane society executes about 68% of all of the animals they get each year ? 

The Human Society Annual Report :

Page 11 of the annual report states they received 23,876 animals last year, of which 12,174 were cats.

Page 12 shows that of those, only 7,453 Animals were adopted, of which 2,776 were cats.

So, 12,174 cats show up, 2,776 make it out. So, 78% of the cats are unaccounted for. Where did 9,398 cats go ? That is about 25 cats a day, every day for 365 days. But the rest of the state is bad for considering mass killing cats ? give me a break. It appears they can kill over 16,000 animals and that is OK, but if any random person kills one they may go to jail.

"Time to get off the bus

Unless the city is ready to do something innovative with transit, studying the issue again is a waste of time and money. And there is little evidence the city wants to innovate. Besides, there really is no city bus problem.

Unless the city is ready to do something innovative with transit, studying the issue again is a waste of time and money.

And there is little evidence the city wants to innovate.

Besides, there really is no city bus problem.

The people who need to ride the bus do so. Those with cars drive. Simple. So what‚Äôs the problem?

Well, you might argue, people should ride the bus. It‚Äôs good for the environment.

Which might be true. But so what?

Beyond talk and empty gestures, society demonstrates little willingness to make the sacrifices necessary to safeguard the environment.

People drive because it‚Äôs easy. They don‚Äôt associate the cost of fillups, oil changes and regular maintenance with their seven-minute drive to work each morning. It is a habit, the cost is deferred and, of course, convenience trumps all.

If gas were $1.75 a litre, parking were scarce and spaces cost drivers $200 a month, $250 with electrical hookup, things might change.

People might consider taking the bus.

But that‚Äôs not the situation today. Driving in Whitehorse is still relatively cheap and definitely easy. So most of us drive. Everywhere.

And the buses zip around empty.

Yet the bus issue surfaces every year, or so. The city vows to study the problem. And so it does ‚Äì examining routes and fares and schedules.

Then everything stays the same. The people who need to ride the bus gather at wind-whipped stops. The rest of us drive past them, oblivious.

This happens because nobody is willing to address the real problem. Which isn‚Äôt buses at all.

It‚Äôs cars.

If it were more expensive and difficult to drive, fewer people would do it. Demand for the bus system would increase.

The dynamic would change.

But that‚Äôs not likely in the near future. Especially with a private developer proposing to increase the number of parking stalls downtown.

When it comes to improving transit, the problem isn‚Äôt buses. It‚Äôs cars.

Any successful plan would lay out how the city was going to make driving more expensive and less convenient. That‚Äôs the key to building support for a public bus system.",0,en,0

"Lewis Hamilton celebrated his 200th Formula One race by reducing Sebastian Vettel's lead at the summit of the championship following his victory at the Belgian Grand Prix.

Twenty-four hours after Hamilton equalled Michael Schumacher's all-time pole position record, the Briton led virtually every lap here in the Ardennes to hold off a late challenge from Vettel, who crossed the line 2.3 seconds behind his title rival.

Hamilton's victory at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit takes him to within seven points of Vettel ahead of next week's Italian Grand Prix.

Daniel Ricciardo completed the podium for Red Bull, while Fernando Alonso's miserable season took yet another miserable twist following his seventh retirement of the year.

Hamilton secured his 68th career pole with a blistering lap around this famous 4.3-mile circuit on Saturday and looked on course for a straightforward win following an equally blistering start.

But after dominating the vast majority of the race, the 12th round of this see-saw championship nearly turned on its head on lap 29 when the Force India team-mates of Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon collided for the second time in their last five outings.

Perez moved across to cover Ocon's move on the run-up to Eau Rouge, and in doing so provoked a collision which saw him sustain a right-rear puncture, and his team-mate a damaged front wing.

""Guys, what the f***?,"" an incandescent Ocon yelled over the radio. ""Honestly. Idiot.""

As the Force India duo limped back to the pits, the safety car was deployed to clear the debris.

Hamilton, while being kept honest by Vettel, was in control of the race. But as the safety car was sent out he dived in for a new set of tyres. Vettel followed his rival in, with the former taking on the supposedly quicker ultrasoft compound. Hamilton took on the soft rubber, the more durable but slowest of the three tyres available this weekend.

A flustered Hamilton clearly sensed danger from Vettel, and queried why the safety car had been deployed.

""Why have they got the safety car out?,"" he asked. ""There is literally no debris anywhere. That's a BS (bulls***) call from the stewards.""

Four laps later, the safety car peeled in, and Hamilton, as he did in Azerbaijan earlier this summer, began to bunch the pack.

On that occasion in Baku, Vettel hit Hamilton in the rear, and then drove alongside his rival before banging wheels. There was no such repeat here today, but Vettel knew passing Hamilton at the restart was his best chance of winning the race.

Vettel was within centimetres of Hamilton's Mercedes as they sped up Eau Rouge and on to the Kemmel Straight at 200 miles per hour.

Vettel pulled to Hamilton's left, but the British driver placed his car in the middle of the track and the Ferrari man was unable to find a way past at Les Combes.

It was an expert piece of defensive driving from Hamilto, which would - despite Vettel's best efforts in the closing stages - enable him to win the race and claim his fifth win of the campaign.

Behind him, Ricciardo claimed the final spot on the podium after he passed Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas at the restart. Bottas fell off the road, and finished fifth, one spot behind Ferrari's
Kimi Raikkonen.

For Alonso, it marked yet another failure to reach the chequered flag. The Spaniard had been as high as seventh following a scintillating opening lap in which he moved up three places.

But his under-powered Honda engine was exploited lap after lap, and he began to fall down the order.

""Embarrassing,"" the Spaniard, out of contract with McLaren at the end of the season, shouted on the team radio.

He then asked for radio silence before parking his car on lap 27 with an apparent engine problem. His retirement came moments after he had asked whether rain was forecast to hit the race. When Alonso was informed it was not, he called it a day.

Max Verstappen also endured another difficult day after his Red Bull suffered a mechanical failure in front of an estimated 80,000 Dutch fans.

Hamilton's third victory in Belgium comes more than two decades after he visited the Spa-Francorchamps track for his first Formula One race with his father Anthony.

""I came here in 1996 with my dad,"" Hamilton said.

""It was our dream to be here one day. We were nobodies. So, hopefully this just shows that dreams do come true and you just have to keep striving for excellence and never give up.

""It has been a strong weekend for myself and the team. Sebastian put a great fight on, but this is what I said I was coming to do, and I did it.""

Vettel added: ""It was good fun and really intense. I was waiting for Lewis to make a mistake and he didn't. He was probably waiting for me to make a mistake and I didn't.

""At the restart, I was fearing that I was not close enough, but I was too close, so at the top of the hill I had to go to the outside and there was nowhere to go.""",1,en,1
"""When the shepherd becomes a wolf, the first duty of the flock is to defend itself. Treachery like that of Nestorius is rare in the church, but it may happen that some pastors keep silence for one reason or another in circumstances when religion itself is at stake.""

Thanks be to God for his honesty and courage, which were the instrument of the transmission of the true and saving faith to us.""

""Let us pray today for our shepherds, the Holy Father and bishops, that they may have the wisdom and courage to defend the faith at all times so that the flock may remain one with Christ and thus obtaining eternal salvation.""

Some of them began filling the downtown streets before the sun even rose over the city of Houston, all for the love of the Astros.

On Friday afternoon, the city of Houston hosted just the third championship parade in its history (the most recent was the 1995 parade for the Rockets) and hundreds of thousands of Houstonians came out to see the team aboard floats, if only for a few minutes.

And there was no way,  no how that the ""Good of Canada"" (as stated by Trudeau when approving Kinder Morgan) would have ever led to upsetting Quebec.

"The Truth About Men

1) All men are vain2) All men are arrogant3) Most men are stupidand 4) Man‚Äôs greatest fear is that women is figure out just how scared they are of them.

So let‚Äôs go through these one-by-one.

First, when women get up in the morning they will look at themselves in the bathroom mirror and think: ‚ÄúOh my god, I look like a disaster area. This will take me hours to put right.‚Äù Men, on the other hand, wake up in the morning, look at themselves in the mirror and ‚Äì bar a major hangover ‚Äì declare: ‚ÄúHot damn, does anyone ever look as good as me in the morning?‚Äù And this despite all protestations to the contrary from anyone else.

Second, not only do men think this about themselves but they cannot quite understand how it is the rest of the world fails to register this simple fact as clearly as they do. They cannot grasp that not every woman, as soon as she sees him, instantly wants to have sex with him. He gets that social graces prevent this from happening on most occasions but, he figures, secretly they all want me. And when a woman, any woman, fails to fall for his charms then clearly, and without question, the only reason for that is that she must be a lesbian. After all, that just stands to reason, right? By the same token, gay men, too, self-evidently want to have sex with him at the slightest provocation and only his own rampant heterosexuality prevents this from happening. But secretly, he knows, they all want him which is why he has to be extremely careful in their company just in case his pheromones are playing tricks on him and giving off the wrong signals.

Third, while most men believe this of themselves a few are enlightened enough to have realized the truth. But only a few. The problem with women is that their default position is that ALL men are stupid when this is clearly not the case and women that refuse to accept this are themselves guilty of rank stupidity.

But men‚Äôs stupidity is relatively easy to spot. For instance, despite being hopelessly lost they will refuse to ask anyone how to get to their desired destination. Somehow both asking for help and an inability to read a map are deemed ‚Äòunmanly‚Äô and therefore to be avoided at all costs. Or ask any man to put up a shelf and he will set about the task with gusto despite having zero carpentry skills under the presumption that since his father could do it then this talent must have been passed on in the genes. The reality is that his father probably couldn‚Äôt and those shelves stayed pinned to the wall on nothing more than a wing-and-a-prayer. But, again, getting a professional in to do the job would be seen as ‚Äòunmanly‚Äô.

And all this adds up to the secret fear that all men keep buried inside them: That women will work out that they are pretty useless at most things. And worst of all, if women ever did figure this out they would feel bereft of any sense of purpose. For millennia men have been told that they are stronger, smarter and it is their duty to rule. The fact that all societies, throughout the world, operate much better when women hold the purse-strings does not enter into this consideration.

For women the answer is relatively simple: Waiting for a man to pluck up enough courage to ask you out is foolish. He is desperately afraid that you will say no and then trample all over his fragile ego. So just ask him.

And if a man, any man, is spending time around you but hasn‚Äôt asked you out do not assume either that he is gay or just wants to be friends. No, he wants to have sex with you but is too scared that you‚Äôll say no and crush him. Does he arrange to have his coffee breaks and lunch breaks when you do? Does he delay his departure from work to get the same bus as you or walk to your respective cars at the same time? Then he wants to have sex with you. Don‚Äôt go around saying: ‚ÄúI had no idea!‚Äù ‚Äì wake up. The only male this will not apply to is your brother. So now you know.

And speaking of knowing, here‚Äôs something else you might want to bear in mind. Men have three topics of conversation: Cars, sports and women. Now, obviously it isn‚Äôt true that that‚Äôs all men talk about away from their women but they will almost certainly only move onto those subjects when they have absolutely exhausted these three. So if you actually want to make yourself as attractive as possible to your potential mate, then try and learn the basics about cars and sports. Any man will think he has struck the jackpot if he finds a woman he is dating can actually hold a conversation about these golden subjects.

OK, given this information any woman who fails to be able to manipulate her chosen man into doing precisely what she wants ‚Äì within a reasonable time-frame ‚Äì clearly hasn‚Äôt been paying enough attention. Go back to the beginning and read it all again. You have been warned.",1,en,1

"Sen. Flake to DOD: Show me the money

Waste warrior Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) has once again proven he‚Äôs on the taxpayer‚Äôs side. Flake just secured another win to reduce wasteful spending, this time shepherding an amendment as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to include price tags for their research projects in all press releases and media statements. Said Sen. Flake:

With the national debt now surpassing $20 trillion, putting this measure on the president‚Äôs desk will send a clear signal that Congress is paying attention to how taxpayers‚Äô hard-earned money is being spent

Right now, as WCW has repeatedly documented, it is difficult or impossible to determine the amount of tax dollars spent on often-wasteful research projects and Flake‚Äôs legislation will help remedy this problem.

As we told Federal News Radio, ‚ÄúThese studies might make a funny headline, but unfortunately taxpayers are stuck footing the bill for research that is often wasteful, unnecessary and in some cases just outright stupid.‚Äù

Earlier this year, following an investigation by WCW and Restore Accountability, Sen. Flake secured an audit of violations of federal funding disclosure law by National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded animal experimenters receiving $15 billion in tax dollars annually. Our report found that 100% of Ivy League press releases about NIH-funded animal experiments failed to include the amount of federal funding received, as required by law. The wasteful studies included a taxpayer-funded ‚Äúmouse fight club‚Äù and simulating what it would sound like if monkeys said ‚ÄúWill you marry me?‚Äù in English.

"That is not what I said. The question is how much real wealth creation has increased since 1986.  Real wealth is created when goods or services are produced at below their production costs as determined by free markets, resulting in a profit.  

Native corps do much of their work providing low value services (hotels for example), which are not rigorous supports for an economy.  Service industries will greatly suffer, just as they did in '86.  Also, they contract for governments, which does not create activities outside of what would be produced otherwise.  This is especially true in the since that many of the contracts are dependent on at least partial state funding, which will be short in coming.

Native corps might ""buffer"", but how successful they will be in truly deferring economic decline is yet to be seen.  Native corps are involved in some wealth producing projects like Red Dog or the Donlin Project.

"`  == Vienna ==  Dude, seriously.  WP:RS and WP:V don't get thrown out the window just because Mary Jo Foley of microsoft-watch.com provides an unattributable and unverifiable quote from a so-called ``spokesman`` about the change in name.  Nobody at Microsoft with a name has bothered to come out and say ``Yes, the name is Vienna`` in the last few days.  Doesn't that strike you as somewhat odd?  We can trace back the origin of almost every other recent code name to a blog entry by a developer team, or a page on Microsoft's web site.  Not this time.  I'm not going to bother with renaming back to Windows Blackcomb, since you'll probably change it back to Vienna without bothering with that nagging Wikipedia requirement of verifiability.  This isn't a race.   :Okay... What's the point of these constant reverts back to Blackcomb? I'm really sure now that the codename is ``Vienna``. The change was recent, let's not make a big deal of it not being mentioned everywhere. No offense, but you seem to like the name Blackcomb much better than Vienna. Get over it. It was changed. Now it wasn't only Scoble who confirmed it. My guess is they were trying to keep it secret for some reason. Several sources claim it's ``Vienna``, so let's keep it that way. There were rumours about ``Longhorn`` being changed to ``Vista``, but later it was confirmed. Let's just leave the article alone for right now. ‚Äî  `",0,en,0

"Q:

Python local class leak

Would this leak the outer class object ?
class Base:
    def AppendToMenu(self,menu,window,data): pass
    def Execute(self,event): pass

class Outer(Base):

    def AppendToMenu(self,menu,window,data):
        if len(data) == 1:
                _leak = self # ?
                class _Inner(Base):        
                    def Execute(self, event):
                        _leak.Execute(event)

                cl = _Inner()
                cl.AppendToMenu(menu,window,data)
        # else...

    def Execute(self,event): self.handle(event)

Would then this be ok?
class Outer(Base):    
    def AppendToMenu(self,menu,window,data):
        if len(data) == 1:
                class _Inner(Base):
                    def __init__(self, outer):
                        self.outer = outer
                    def Execute(self, event):
                        self.outer.Execute(event)

                cl = _Inner(self)
                cl.AppendToMenu(menu,window,data)

Coming from Java so new to closures.

A:

Neither method will lead to leaks.
The lifetime of Python objects is governed by reference counting; if there are no references left, the object is removed. In all cases here are the instances and classes in your Outer.AppendToMenu() method only referenced by locals, and will not lead to leaks.
In both your cases, the counts for the class and instance are as follows:

class _Inner creates the class, ref count is 1 (the local name _inner)
cl = _Inner() creates the instance, ref count for the instance is 1, the _Inner class reference goes up to 2 as the instance references its class.
The Outer.AppendToMenu() method exits, and the locals are cleared. _Inner and cl are cleared, decrementing their reference counts by 1 to 1 and 0 respectively. The cl instance is removed, taking with it the remaining reference to the _Inner class, so it is deleted too.

The closure over the reference to the Outer instance (through _leak / self) is never used, so no additional references to the Outer instance are created.
Personally, I'd pick the closure option here, provided I couldn't first remove the need to use a local class object in that method in the first place.

Moelis is less worried about his business than those corporations that have loaded up on cheap debt during the era of low interest rates. ""Access to capital was the whole thing in the '80s. The world has changed,"" Moelis said at the Baron conference. ""Liquidity in the world markets is unbelievable today. Capital is no longer a barrier. Capital is being thrown at you by multiple sources."" And that may soon become a big problem, Moelis said, due to the direction in interest rates. He provided a note of caution about debt at the Baron conference, as well as some other lessons on capital markets deal-making, a few of them unconventional.

It won't take too big a move in interest rates to throttle many companies.

Moelis is intimately familiar with high-stress debt situations, from his representation of Trump at a time when Trump companies were facing bankruptcy to representation of Dubai went it was staring down hedge fund creditors in the late 2000s. He expects a wave of indebted companies to face critical restructuring issues before the current economic cycle resets. The reason: interest rates. The Federal Reserve didn't raise interest rates at its meeting last week, but it is expected to raise rates one more time this year when it meets again in December. It won't take a major move up in interest rates to start causing trouble in the high-yield debt marketplace, according to Moelis. ""There is a lot of leverage in the world and you don't need a big move in interest rates, and they are moving up,"" Moelis said.

Moelis pointed to the current default rate in the high-yield bond sector as a warning sign. Currently, only about two percent of paper defaults. During the financial crisis, the default rate was above 10 percent. While 10 percent might not even seem that high, Moelis said the important point is that ""there is a lot of room between two percent and 10 percent."" The concerns Moelis has about levered companies is reflected in research from Moody's Investors Service. Moody's noted earlier this year that the ratio of corporate debt to GDP was at a record, and noted that the previous times the debt-to-GDP ratio was this high all coincided with market crises and recessions ‚Äî 2009, 2001 and 1990. Yet in all of those previous three cases, the default rate posted was substantially higher ‚Äî 11.1 percent, 10.5 percent, and 10.1 percent, respectively. Moody's estimates that the 2019 high-yield default rate would be in the range of two percent; it has been roughly 3 percent this year. The rating agency also predicted that a ""particularly"" large wave of junk bond defaults is coming. ""At some point in this cycle there will be a lot of restructuring,"" Moelis said. That might be good for him ‚Äî his bank has one of the top restructuring businesses on Wall Street ‚Äî but it also will place many companies on the fine line between existence and extinction. ""It's a key moment to keep a company out of bankruptcy,"" he said. Moelis has made some good calls in recent years. Among them, one from September 2016: he predicted Trump would win the presidency.

How NOT to flip a coin over $1 million (with Donald Trump or anyone else).

Working with Trump led, not surprisingly, to another ""art of the deal"" issue ‚Äî getting Trump to pay Moelis for his banking services. Nudged on by Ron Baron, Moelis told attendees at the Baron conference a story that has become one of his staple anecdotes about his relationship with Trump. Moelis met Trump in 1992 when he had just started working for Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, and hadn't done banking for him yet. ""I flew into New York on the red eye. You had to caffeinate yourself for Trump, and I had a 7-Eleven Big Gulp of coffee. We met in one of his conference rooms and after 20 minutes, classic Trump, he looks at me and says, 'How much?' Moelis threw out a number ‚Äî ""looking back I should have just doubled it,"" he recalled at the Baron conference. ""Obviously, I wasn't getting it."" It came down to Moelis and Trump being $1 million apart. ""Donald said after five minutes, 'I will flip you for it.'"" Moelis had his doubts, working for a new firm and wondering whether it was even legal to flip a coin for a million dollars, and wondering whether he could ever tell his new colleagues. But ""I thought if I don't flip, I lose, so it is at least 50-50."" But at the last second, Moelis remembered the most important part of a coin flip deal. ""I said, 'Let me see the coin.' It was embarrassing, but it was a million dollars."" The coin was legitimate. But it wouldn't matter. Moelis flipped the coin in a high arc, too high, he soon realized. ""I see the coin bouncing and I know it will go off the table on his side, and know if it hits the floor, I will lose a million,"" Moelis said. ""I dove, and got there too late."" ""Heads, you lose,"" Trump told him, already with the coin in hand. Moelis said that to this day he has told Trump, ""If I really lost, you would have left it on the floor.""

When creditors are across the table, it is often best to let your banker do the talking.

Moelis has had plenty of clients who have sat across the table from creditors at times of crisis, and his advice to one high-profile, high-energy and talkative client who has a history of considering himself among the world's greatest dealmakers, was simple: let the banker do the negotiating. Moelis and Trump were about to go into a room with 15 lawyers representing creditors. Moelis asked Trump to say nothing and let him do the talking. Moelis remembers aggressively offering creditors a ""take it or leave it"" deal and telling them they had 10 minutes to decide. When Moelis and Trump left the room to give the creditors their time, Trump turned to Moelis and said, ""Can we do that?"" Moelis said ""I don't know, but neither do they."" The art of that deal ended in success.

"The Gauteng sports, arts, culture and recreation department has started an internal disciplinary process against employee Velaphi Khumalo over his racist Facebook comments.

Acknowledging him as an employee, the department distanced itself from the ""barbaric and racist utterances"" made by Khumalo.

The racist remarks were his personal views and the department did not condone such hateful and disturbing racial slurs, it said in a statement on Wednesday night.

‚ÄúThe department of sport, arts, culture and recreation views the hateful post by Velaphi Khumalo in a serious light,"" MEC Faith Mazibuko said.

""Our key mandate is nation building and social cohesion. His sentiments take our country backwards and do not reflect what the Gauteng provincial government stands for.‚Äù

The department has a communication policy which guides how employees must conduct themselves on social media.

An internal process was underway to address the matter, it said.

Khumalo called for black South Africans to do to white people what ""Hitler did to the Jews"".

He said he hated all white people.

""I want to cleans this country of all white people. we must act as Hitler did to the Jews. I don‚Äôt believe any more that the is a large number of not so racist whit people .

After numerous complaints from irate South Africans, Khumalo's Facebook page was deleted on Wednesday.

A charge of crimen injuria has also been laid against him.

The SA Jewish Board of Deputies would also be laying a complaint against him with the SA Human Rights Commission, National Director Wendy Kahn said in a statement.

Somehow I suspect we would find in that history, a movement through the ages that identifies different doctrines at different times as being ""dogma.""

The conventional totally-enclosed type motor structure is roughly constituted further by two bearing members 102 for rotatively supporting the rotor shaft 101, two bracket members 103 for closing the axial ends of the stator frame 104, an exterior fan 112 which is arranged on the shaft 101 outside of the bracket member 103, and an end covering member 113 for covering the exterior fan 112.
With a conventional totally-enclosed type motor of the above stated construction, almost all heat loss, which is generated in the stator core 105, the stator winding 106, the rotor core 107 and the rotor winding 108, is heat-transferred to the stator frame 104 through the stator core 105 by heat conduction. Further, as a result of a fan operation produced by an end portion of the rotor winding 108, as shown by a dotted line arrow in FIG. 4A, the interior air is agitated and heat is transferred to an inner face of the stator frame 104 and an inner face of the bracket member 103 through heat conduction. Therefore, a part of the heat loss is heat-transferred to the stator frame 104 through heat conduction. The heat being heat-transferred to the stator frame 104 is heat-radiated toward the outside of the motor and is conducted away by the exterior cooling air flow, as shown with a solid line arrow in FIG. 4A, produced by the exterior fan 112.
Another structure of a conventional totally-enclosed type motor is shown in FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B, and such a totally-enclosed type motor is disclosed, for example, in Japanese utility model laid open No. 88,454/1987. The totally-enclosed type motor structure shown in FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B differs from the totally-enclosed type motor shown in FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B in the following points.
The stator frame 104 of this totally-enclosed type motor structure has plural inside ventilation passages 104a, plural outside ventilation passages 104b, and an interior fan 109. The inside ventilation passages 104a are formed by the inside surface of the stator frame 104 and are spaced with a predetermined interval in the peripheral direction, as seen in FIG. 5B, and extend continuously in the axial direction, as seen in FIG. 5A. The outside ventilation passages 104b are provided on an outside surface of the stator frame 104 and extend continuously in the axial direction and are spaced in the peripheral direction between adjacent inside ventilation passages 104a, as seen in FIG. 5B. The interior fan 109 is arranged in the stator frame 104, so that by rotating the fan 109 together with the rotor shaft 101, the interior cooling air, which has cooled the stator core 105 and the rotor core 107, is sent out and is circulated through the inside ventilation passages 104a.
Two flows of cooling air are produced in the totally-enclosed type motor structure as shown by the arrows in FIG. 5A. First of all, the interior cooling air flow, which has been produced by the interior fan 109, as shown with dotted line arrows in FIG. 5A, passes through the inside ventilation passages 104a which are formed at the inner face of the stator frame 104. After that, the interior cooling air is distributed and passed through the air gap 110 and axial ducts 111. The interior cooling air then is returned again to the interior fan 109 and is continuously circulated.
Further, the exterior cooling air flow, as shown by solid line arrows in FIG. 5A, is drawn into an air inlet port 113a, which is provided on the end covering member 113 by the exterior fan 112. The exterior cooling air passes through the outside ventilation passages 104b, which are provided at an outside portion of the stator frame 104, and is then discharged to the outside.
A further conventional totally-enclosed type motor structure is disclosed in, for example, Japanese utility model laid-open No. 113,562/1989. This conventional totally-enclosed type motor structure is shown in FIG. 6A, FIG. 6B and FIG. 6C.
In the totally-enclosed type motor structure shown in FIG. 6A, FIG. 6B and FIG. 6C, the motor has no exterior fan, in contrast to the above stated former totally-enclosed type motor structures. In place of the exterior fan, in the totally-enclosed type motor structure shown in FIG. 6A, FIG. 6B and FIG. 6C, one end of a heat pipe 115 is projected toward and into the interior of the inside ventilation passage 104a. Plural heat radiation fins 117 are provided on the heat pipe 115 and are arranged on opposite sides of the inner projected heat pipe 115 so as to extend toward the outside of the inside ventilation passage 104a of the heat pipe 115 or outside of an outer frame 116. With the above stated totally-enclosed type motor structure, as shown in FIG. 6A, FIG. 6B and FIG. 6C, an enlargement of the heat-receiving area is attained by the provision of the heat pipe 115 having plural heat radiation fins 117.
In the conventional totally-enclosed type motor structure shown in FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B, since the interior cooling air is merely agitated, the amount of heat radiation is extremely small. As one example, the amount of heat radiation produced by the agitation is about 12% of the total heat radiation as one calculation example. Thus, the conventional totally-enclosed type motor structure shown in FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B has a defect in that there is a serious limitation on the heat transfer amount possible with this construction.
Further, in the conventional totally-enclosed type motor structure shown in FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B, the motor has two paths along which heat is transferred to the stator frame 104, these two paths providing for heat conduction (A) from the stator core 105 and heat transfer (B) due to the interior cooling air flow. The temperature rise in the motor is influenced by the total heat transfer resulting from the amount of the above stated heat conduction (A) added to the amount of the above stated heat transfer (B). For example, the heat conduction (A) can be made large by increasing the area of contact of the stator core 105 and the stator frame 104, however the heat transfer amount due to the heat transfer (B) will be small as a result. On the other hand, the heat transfer (B) can be made large by increasing the size of the inside ventilation passage 104a or the number thereof, however the heat transfer amount due to the heat conduction (A) will be made small as a result. Accordingly, the conventional totally-enclosed type motor structure shown in FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B has a defect in that there is a serious limitation on the heat transfer amount in the motor having such a construction.
Further, in the conventional totally-enclosed type motor structure shown in FIG. 6A, FIG. 6B and FIG. 6C, the heat radiation fins 117 are mounted on one side of the heat pipe 115 and are formed at the outside of the stator frame 104. The pitch in the axial direction of the arrangement of the heat pipes 115 is at least more than an outer diameter of the heat radiation fins 117, therefore there is a serious limitation on any increase in the heat-receiving area in the motor having this construction. Further, since there is no cooling fan provided outside of the stator frame 104, the heat removal is caused only by natural heat radiation, and therefore, there is a serious limitation on the heat transfer in the motor having this construction.",0,en,0

Time for Nuclear War

Great news! Kim Jong Il is dead. The heir apparent unfortunately does not appear to be a reformer who will introduce democracy, but is instead someone who is just as big a bastard as his father and grandfather. And the guy is young, which means we can look forward to his despotic rule for another 50 years, during which they will almost certainly be able to perfect their nuclear capability.

No thanks.

It's time to seize the moment. Survival of the human race is at stake. I don't want to see this peanut threatening the world with nuclear annihilation in 40 years from now. Whatever he has - let's get it out into the open now. And if China wishes to join in - let's get that rogue nation to show its true colours too so that we can fight a proper Cold War with it.

My recommendation is to forget about Syria and Iran for now. Do an airborne landing in North Korea, secure an airfield, then strike out to a port city. Do all this from aircraft carriers, not South Korea. Let South Korea scream obscenities about all this so that hopefully North Korea doesn't attack Seoul, which is in artillery range. If Seoul is attacked by artillery, then don't fuck around - literally nuke the artillery positions.

Hopefully there will be a short period of confusion in North Korea, as Kim Jong-un hasn't solidified his position yet. That's why now is the time to strike. The US troops have left Iraq now, and had a chance for a short break, so now it's time to redeploy to where they're needed for the future of humanity. Oh, and a good thing about this war is that it already has UN approval, as the previous UN approval never expired.

Nuclear weapons are a real downer, and we need to be honest about these damn things and get the threat out into the open. Collect Pakistan's nukes too. We just need to live with whatever damage they can do before we get our hands on them. Better that than our descendants needing to deal with a larger arsenal.",1,en,1

Yes, it has surprised me how quick on the draw (and vituperative) some folks have been in expunging any reference to the alleged/purported/apparent Israeli espionage. As happens in other contexts, I think some people conflate criticism of Israel with anti-semitism  or conflate this intentionally. The ironic thing is that if all this stuff is true (as seems at least worth serious consideration), it even reflects well on Israel, as there is evidence Israel warned the US that something big was coming. All countries spy; to me, that's not such a big deal.

Even if they would be able to see the same spectrum as us, it remains doubtful if those images will mean anything to them at first glance. However, the point here is to convey information. While we can look at a picture at all wavelengths, it is only in the visible spectrum that information on this picture (patterns and variations) start to appear (at other wavelengths, its blank). An analogy would be satellites using SARs to pierce the cloud cover of Venus and image its surface.   There is little information in the visible spectrum but lots outside of it. If the information is encoded in a digital form (eg: RGB) rather than displayed using our technology, then they will interpret it in colors they can see as this encoding is not relative to a specific spectrum. Still, they should be able to figure out what king of colors we meant to encode in the first place by looking at the probes themselves and the markings on them. I think that the aliens will be able to make sense of this information easily. Regardless, I completely agree with you. It will take them years to analyze what we have sent them and make sense of it (ie: convert it to something they can relate to), but if they feel as lonely as us, then I trust that they will invest the resources and time.",0,en,0

"The Source of Creativity

What makes an artist creative? Is it the same source that produces innovation in business? Can it be developed or is it something you are born with? These are questions which have gripped writers, critics and commentators for over 2 000 years and which author, journalist and thinker Walter Isaacson has been exploring in a series of acclaimed biographies. His latest is about the Renaissance polymat

I‚Äôve always been interested in people who combine art and science. That‚Äôs what Einstein was about, Steve Jobs, that‚Äôs what he was about, also Ben Franklin, and I believe that when you do that, you have real creativity. Leonardo was the ultimate in doing that. He loved everything from anatomy to zoology, as well as art, and by doing so, it made him creative. So, my books try to explore what is creativity and how it happens.

Da Vinci left just over a dozen paintings, including, of course, the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, but you come at him through his Codexes ‚Äì or notebooks, as we would call them. These are a dense jungle of jottings, scribblings, drawings, remarks, thoughts and more. Why did you take that approach?

I think that other scholars focus on his art masterpieces, the 15 or 20 that he left, and they don‚Äôt realise that he considered himself an engineer as much as an artist, and that he didn‚Äôt make much of a distinction between his art and his science and his engineering. Whether it‚Äôs Vitruvian Man or the smile of the Mona Lisa, they were works of great art and also works of great science. By going page by page through the more than 7 000 pages we have left of his notebooks, you can see how his mind jumps from one discipline to another and how he sees patterns in nature.

You quote art historian Sir Kenneth Clark, who described Leonardo as ‚Äúthe most relentlessly curious man in history‚Äù, but that curiosity was also ‚Äì perhaps ‚Äì a weakness: he was forever darting off in new directions, failing to finish commissions, turning down new ones and generally missing what we would call deadlines. As you put it, ‚ÄúHe was a genius undisciplined by diligence.‚Äù

One thing we can learn is simply to be very, very observant...

Yes, Kenneth Clark called him ‚Äòthe most curious man in history‚Äô and I think Clark also implied it was a bit of a weakness ‚Äì Leonardo didn‚Äôt finish things, he got distracted easily. I think that‚Äôs wrong. I think the fact that he got distracted and his mind hopped around from figuring out how the aortic heart valve works (Hundreds of years before modern medical science confirmed that finding ‚Äì Ed.) to figuring out how bird wings work, to figuring out how to paint the reactions of people in The Last Supper as a narrative, was part of a whole. I think that without his interest and curiosity about everything there was to know, he wouldn‚Äôt have had such a feel for the patterns of nature.

Before he was famous as a painter, he had carved out a niche for himself at the court in Milan as a designer of pageants‚Ä¶could we call him a showman? More of a George Lucas than a Steve Jobs?

His joy at doing theatrical productions and spectacles and plays is reflected in his art and his science. The first flying machine we know of him drawing, which looks like a helicopter, was actually a prop for one of the plays. His first drawing was of a costume, a warrior, for one of the plays that was happening. It helped him blur fantasy with reality, and even if you look at his great paintings, such as The Last Supper, it looks like a theatrical stage set, the way the perspective recedes artificially, the way the gestures of the people are a bit exaggerated, and how it creates a narrative.

One of the most important points about Leonardo is that he didn‚Äôt just believe ‚Äì he prodded, probed, lifted the lid and even cut into human bodies to find answers to his myriad questions?

He was curious for its own sake after a while. For example, he dissects human bodies in order to get the neck muscles right when he‚Äôs painting St. Jerome in the Wilderness, but then he keeps dissecting, he dissects the whole spine and then the heart and then the liver, and you don‚Äôt need to do that to paint a painting. You need to do it if you‚Äôre relentlessly curious, and so one of the things that I admired was that he was curious for curiosity‚Äôs sake. For example, one of the questions he puts in his notebook is ‚ÄòDescribe the tongue of a Woodpecker‚Äô. That‚Äôs not something you need to know to paint a bird or make a flying machine, but it is something you need to know if you‚Äôre just curious about how everything works.

You end the preface to the book by suggesting that Leonardo‚Äôs ‚Äúability to combine art, science, technology, the humanities, and imagination remains an enduring recipe for creativity‚Äù. Can we really apply that in the modern workplace?

If you look at what Steve Jobs did, he was curious about everything and when he designed the iPod, for example, one of his principles was ‚Äúbeauty really matters‚Äù and that‚Äôs why the iPod, and not the Microsoft Zoom or the Sony Walkman, became the standard music player for years. Understanding the patterns of nature and how to emotionally connect to those patterns becomes a legacy for anybody trying to write a book or paint a painting or make a piece of electronics.

...one of the questions he puts in his notebook is ‚ÄòDescribe the tongue of a Woodpecker‚Äô...

In the world of business, we look continually for ways of finding the next Leonardo or the next Jobs or Franklin, of stimulating ourselves and our equally prosaic colleagues into moments of brilliance, if not genius. What can we learn from Leonardo to help us stumble along that path with a little more certainty?

One thing we can learn is simply to be very, very observant or very, very curious. This was something we all knew how to do when we were children, and somehow, when we finish our ‚Äòwonder‚Äô years, we forget how to be relentlessly curious. I think that it‚Äôs important for all of us to ‚Äúalways stay curious and stay hungry‚Äù, as Steve Jobs once said.",0,en,0
