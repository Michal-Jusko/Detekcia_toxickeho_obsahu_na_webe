Certainly no concept that the people they are dealing with tend to be incredibly intelligent, and tend to network with others, and will tell people to steer clear of certain companies that don't project the right attitudes.


In other words, the evaluation done during an ""interview"" is a TWO WAY street, not one way. Companies that think they are there to interrogate a subject to see if they will sing and dance just so are doing it wrong.

Why?

Because eventually, a DNC member will apologize that they did not understand that they were hitting the 'send'  button rather than the 'delete'  button.

Women are indeed within control of not only their bodies, but their biological ability to give birth, and if they do not want to become a mother, than they should take whatever steps they need to so as to prevent said action.

THAT is the female power.

We would have had a church the youth could have followed & respected since he lacked misogyny & was genuinely a man founded in the actual teachings in the Gospel of Christ.  We may have already reunited with the Anglican & Lutheran Churches & other possible denominations. We could have a world with far less poverty & violence since misogyny & poverty are directly linked & efforts could have been about passing out birth control to poor people.
We would have had a kinder church to homosexuals & maybe come up with allowing them to have some form of church witnessed union so they and their families would be equally accepted in church.

Traffickers will be breaking the law.  This new law ONLY says that the child involved is a victim of a crime, and not themselves a criminal!!  This does not disallow police from taking these children to child protective services!!  It only means that they will not be treated like criminals, handcuffed, jailed, and saddled with a criminal record for their entire life - which would, in fact, only serve to victimize them further.    

There are other ways to deal with abused children than throwing them in jail and treating them as criminals. Do you not see this?  Why do you see these children as criminals, and not victims of a crime??  And why do you lie??",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

"Aung Sung Suu Kyii has only a ceremonial role in the Burmese government, she is called the 'State Counselor' -- the Burmese military runs the country for the 88% Buddhist majority who want the Rohingya (4.3% of the population) and the Christians (6.2% of the population) and the Hindus (0.5% of the population) out of the country.

If they don't leave, eventually they'll all be killed. 

It's just the way it is there, it will never change. (I've been there)

The level of hatred for the Rohingya by the Buddhist majority is unbelievable.

But Burma's loss is Bangladesh's gain, becuase the Rohingya are amazingly good farmers, even with the crap land they're allowed to live on, but not ever own, in Burma.

If you have the slightest idea how a federal government constructs its finances you would grasp that it is the trend that kills.  Your pal Trudeau campaigned on the basis of 10 billion dollar deficits for a few years... The finance department itself has said we will see deficit till 2050. Canadian banks are forecasting deficits 35 to 40 billion dollars and we're now well on the way to achieving them.

"I suspect it is primarily white liberals that have been surprised by the level of racism and bigotry Trump has managed to harness. Since I'm black, I get reminded daily of the racism in my fellow Americans. One of the more subtle effects of racism is the constant concern minorities must have for the emotional fragility of most of the white people here. If you are black and ignore that, you will never have peace, a job, or you freedom. The truth is that as a nation we have not made peace with our racist heritage. Being polite became ""political correctness"" when us ""others"" demanded the same rights and freedoms that white males have. For example, the 2nd Amendment is a white privilege. Cops routinely kill black people on the suspension of being armed. White men can attend political rallies while armed. We have never had equal protection under the law.
