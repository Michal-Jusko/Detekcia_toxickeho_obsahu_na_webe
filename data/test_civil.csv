Gun ownership is not up to somebody else's whim and caprice or values. The only proven solution to the problem so far is concealed carry... In other words it's the only solution that has had a measurable impact on reducing gun deaths. Gun grabbers have no legitimate reason for the things they are proposing because so far none of their proposals would have saved even one life. Once I realized that the government was behind the Sandy Hook hoax which was designed to manipulate public opinion against gun ownership I became very pro-Second Amendment. A government willing to do what they did at Sandy hoax to deny us our Second Amendment rights...,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

But I believe similarly that in general, the growing problems of white privilege, misogyny, patriarchy, and gun culture in the US are a ticking timebomb. The Southern Poverty Law Center has done some good work tracking some of these threats as well.

DCH gets gov money just like any other hospital. And yes, it gets LOTS of money from ACA. In fact, disproportional more than a regular hospital does. 

IF ACA is overturned, it will not harm DCH. They will continue as before, just incurring more debt that will be funded by increasing other ppl's costs, which will be funded by yours and mine insurance. 

Bear in mind that this WILL be paid. The only question is, how much overhead goes into it. 
With ACA, there is VERY little overhead. We just pay it via taxes.
Without it, then we have to add bill collectors to chase down non-payment, then lawyers to deal with bankruptcy which will happen. Then we pay it with  quickly increasing insurance rates (and they get to hide their outlandish profits)",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

You pretend Toronto and Vancouver prices relate to traditional ""cycles"" in Canadian real estate.

What nonsense.

Pick ANY YEAR you want before the mid 1980s: You could buy a house in Vancouver and Toronto for 3 to 5 times the average annual local income. Pick ANY YEAR you want before the mid 1980s and you could do that.

Look, it is only the past few decades in which house prices have skyrocketed to DOZENS of times the average annual local income in Vancouver, Richmond, South Surrey etc. The prices got THAT HIGH because of overseas money flooding in through the NEWLY CREATED investor immigrant policies implemented in the mid 1980's.

It has nothing to do with Canada's traditional housing cycles.

And, as in wolf, maintaining a healthy ecosystem  functioning as  a valuable  keystone predator  keeping a  population of  ungulates in balance with their habitat.

-Grandstanding chatter about climate change but adopting, almost verbatim, the Harper GHG targets.
- A carbon pricing scheme with nothing in the way of costing made clear to Canadians
- Limp employment numbers and GDP growth scarcely sniffing at 1.0%
-A faltering currency only showing signs of strength when oil +gas prices rise as they have recently

We chant any number of things, and ""Black lives matter,"" is one of the prominent refrains. Also, ""Put the guns down,"" ""Save the babies,"" ""We love you, your are brothers, we love you, your our sons,"" and various other such things.

"My 2 cents. 
Recovery is the biggest word in the English language. It opens the door to hope and with hope, the most destitute human being can work absolute miracles. 
Government can provide that hope, by investing in recovery, both from illness and from bad decisions like drug use and criminal behavior. 

Housing first is a great idea until you pencil it out. Lane County has no, I repeat, no, public shelter system. That should be its first priority. I love the openness to the needs of the homeless and look forward to creative solutions, in partnership with Lane County's Poverty and Homelessness Board. 

If Lane County has $100 million to spend I would hope they would not spend it on a new courthouse, but instead devote some of that money to pubic shelter. Increasingly, more and more Americans are finding themselves unable to pay for shelter. More and more Americans are finding themselves on the street  without hope and a sense any in power care.

"Wow, G&M is actually trying to go way more false propaganda on this issue than even the NYT.
WADA has just announced that 95 of 96 of the first cases of alleged Russian Olympic athlete doping have been dropped, due to there being no evidence to back up McLaren's claims.
Also, WADA has just chided NADO for their call to ban Russia from future Olympics, saying that such actions are not useful. And of course they are not, since their call coincides with WADA revealing that McLaren's allegations of Russian doping are evapourating into thin air.
At this time, the world, particularly propaganda outlets like G&M, owe Russia a very, very big heartfelt apology for baselessly hyping a witch-hunt, and punishing athletes and Russians who didn't deserve any of it, at all.

Unfortunately, all but a small number of students simply treated the one-week extension as the new due date and the same problems appeared, only a week later.

'Last night it was claimed that, keen to make good on Mr Trump's campaign promises on immigration, the White House had drafted the document in a hurry.

It was suggested that they failed to seriously consult the department of homeland security, state department or the justice department, who would all be tasked with enacting the order.

It was even claimed that the Trump administration had actually shielded the document from a formal review by National Security Council lawyers. John Kelly, the homeland security secretary, and other senior figures in the agency only saw the final details shortly before it was issued.

""It was chaos,"" one source said. ""It's hard to know if this White House did this because they don't understand how government works, or willful incompetence.""'

"Thank you Tina for your reply. I agree with your point about appropriation being an artifact of power dynamics and that it is not reversible; if the hegemony coopts a story from a subjugated people, the risk of appropriation is quite high. Almost (but not completely) unavoidable. If a subjugated people tells a story not their own, on the other hand, cultural appropriation is less of a pitfall (though not absolutely zero). And in the case of multimillion-dollar feature films, the profits benefit the studio, not the culture from which the story comes--this, to me, is the biggest issue.  

However, it does not follow that because there are a lot of Jewish people in Hollywood, a film made by a non-Jew about the Holocaust would (or wouldn't) be a form of appropriation.

"Insurance exists to provide a financial surety in the event of damages caused by some action or event.  A car hitting anything causes measurable damage, sometimes catastrophic damage, and insurance makes sense.  A bicycle hitting something generally doesn't cause much more than a couple of scratches to the hittee, notwithstanding the one or two collisions that happen every year when some ID10T hits a ped while racing on a multi-use path or something similar.  How could it - most cyclists don't go much faster than 20kph and weigh something like 90 kg, compared to a car travelling at 40kph and weighing 2000 kg, which translates to about 400 times the force when a car hits something (hey science boys, did i get that calc right??).  The potential downside doesn't justify insurance.

"Thank for the history lesson Mr. Cole but you keep insisting that the PF be used for government services. This is not an absolute certainty.  We have a bloated state government. Cut it to $3 billion or less.   Here is a simple plan that will not ""restructure"" the PFD thus stealing it forever from the people and ultimately draining the entire fund.  First deal with the oilies and repeal SB21, repeal all tax credits to oil companies, impose a tax on each barrel of oil produced. This will prevent chicanery and fraud by the oil lawyers. Tax the gas in the ground until a pipeline is built because the oil companies have had 40 years to bring our gas to market. After this, if more funds are needed impose a TEMPORARY head tax on every PFD check. This is the fairest plan above an income tax or sales tax.  The people will pay attention to government when deductions come from their check, but they will not lose the right to it as ""restructuring"" will surely do.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

"Basic rule -  refugees are not immigrants.  

Refugees are permitted by our law to enter Canada legally or illegally and seek protection per the Immigration and REFUGEE PROTECTION Act (IRPA) implementing our international obligations per the various international conventions relating to refugee protection.  Note s. 133 that exempts refugees from charges for illegal entry to Canada.

Persons who claim refugee status and remain in Canada as permanent residents are a tiny percentage of the yearly landings of immigrants known as Refugees Landed in Canada class (RLC)  The greatest number of immigrants come under the economic classes and are subject to the points system.  In 2010 only 3% of total landings were by the RLC class.  And the RLC do better economically than government sponsored refugees.  Earnings lag slightly compared to Canadians but by year five they catch up.

It's possible to get a special experimental waiver from the FCC for this particular antenna array because it's a grandfathered device. All the paperwork would be much more successful if managed thru a partnership with UAF.

"Interesting point raised here, about the value of hunting to many, over and above the cost to individuals.

The most important discussion, it seems to me, is how much our state Department of Fish and Game should spend state money on management activities that facilitate moose and caribou meat hunting, even when the costs per pound of meat, when everything is toted up, are not competitive with grocery prices. 

Of course the department must protect the resource, but spend millions 'enhancing' the resource for meat hunters? If hunting for many is a choice, how much government assistance for that choice is proper?

I can see how rural areas without easy access and where hunting is less a choice than a necessity -- rural residents may need support at times. For the rest, some serious reconsideration of Fish and Game intensive management standards is due. This is not an anti-meat hunting stance, but let's not be afraid of some self-examination here.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

And the body I saw of the dead highway worker, his body smashed by a delivery truck.

You're quite right in pointing out the absurdity in the government's statement that revenue-neutrality would be achieved by new spending.  Revenue-neutrality means that new revenues collected by the government are offset by foregoing revenues from another source, not by spending that new revenue.  I don't see this government foregoing any current revenue streams at all.

Oh, and BTW, don't forget that the Federal government is reaping a windfall benefit from the Ontario carbon tax of roughly M$54 a year in GST charged on the carbon tax (StatsCan http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/trade37b-eng.htm and $20/ton carbon tax).  ON PST gets M$87.

There are 154,000 individuals who qualify to renew their DACA Status before October 5th, 2017. This process is urgent, complicated, and expensive. It means that many young people have to quickly come up with the $495 renewal fee that would have taken months to raise.

1)  In the eyes of the church (canon law) there are no “married” gays, lesbian, mice, moose or anything else. Canon law states that matrimony occurs between a man and a woman human. Bishop Paprocki’s statement about married lesbians or gays is irrelevant as his only concern is limited to the guidelines of canon law. 

2)  The Catechism of the Church, Chapter 4; Other Liturgical Celebrations Article 2 Christian funerals states nothing about the life of the deceased only that being Baptized gives you the right to have a Catholic funeral. Paprocki’s statement is ludicrous on the face of it as we do not deny funerals for murderers, rapists, or any others rightly or wrongly recognized by society as “evil.” In fact, the Church teaches us that all should be recognized as having “repented” if necessary, before they died.

Our economy is more dependent on international and US economic trends and financial policies than on what our PMs and governments do to influence growth and solvency.  As Dalton Camp observed, ""Washington makes the laws.  Ottawa makes the bi-laws"".

But Canadian PMs and their policies can make the best or the worst of the global and US hands they are dealt.  PMs making the best of bad hands - as Harper did during the global melt down - tend to be trusted by the electorate and get re-elected.  Those who make the worst of bad hands lose their economic credibility and the trust of Canadians and are punished at the polls.

Trudeau 1.0 played his economic and fiscal hands disastrously and voters outside Quebec got wise to this and lost trust in his economic stewardship.  So he squeaked in by just 2 seats in 1972, lost in 1979, and doomed the Liberals to defeat in 1984.
