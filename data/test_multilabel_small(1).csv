Trump's quote on using nuclear weapons.

“I’ve always thought about the issue of nuclear war; it’s a very important element in my thought process. It’s the ultimate, the ultimate catastrophe, the biggest problem this world has, and nobody’s focusing on the nuts and bolts of it. It’s a little like sickness. People don’t believe they’re going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people’s believing it will never happen, because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit.”

"Some good points made here. The article does ""conveniently"" tie in nicely with the reduction of wealth and opportunity for the 99%.

One thing not mentioned is related to the fact that rental stuff is often crap. Rather than buy a circular saw for a small project a few years ago, I rented. The saw was so poorly maintained it wouldn't cut straight. So I returned it and got another. Same problem. All I got was a shrug from the rental company. If I had bought the saw it would have done the job easily and properly.

Now I suppose if rental were the norm, as in short term car rental, that might change. But the rental business is also sometimes a license for rip-off. For example. you can't convince me that leasing a car long term is anywhere near as advantageous as outright ownership.

The fact is, though, that predators use this to their advantage time after time again.  

Remember the infamous U of O case with those 3 basketball players?  The victim there also drank herself to the point where she said that it left her helpless, and unable to consent.  That was a key focus of the investigation: whether she was so drunk that she was unable to give her consent.

In these new cases, it is obvious that rape occurred.  For how can a comatose woman ever possibly give her consent to sex??

"Trump's policy of encouraging 'growth'?

Encouraging growth by holding rallies where he preens for his adoring pawns is not policy.

He hasn't actually created any policy.  He's made a lot of promises, and most of them have been proven to be lies.

No, chris, your cheerleading only indicates you have no clue what growth was attained in the last administration or what specific policies account for that growth.

Trump, though not actually creating any policy yet, has been dismantling and destroying policy enacted by President Obama and just like with the health care fiasco, Trump is going to create more disasters of the same or worse proportion.

What is huge is the likelihood of your cheerleading being all for naught.  

And the people most likely to bear the brunt of Trump's disasters are old folks like you and me.

The difference between me and you is you're cheering for your own demise.

I'm standing against the idiocy.

I'm not the one assuming that people that would come for a moose and bounty would be jack asses nor that it would even operate on such a basis. My guess is no advertisement would be needed and those one scene or shortly thereby would take care of the problem even before the LEO left the scene. And they wouldn't necessarily be jackasses... Only needy families would butcher a road kill moose for $200 btw... Its far easier to make $200 by other means. If that's not true then why is the bounty so high now?

""Arab states rap Qatari reply to demands, refrain from new sanctions""

---

That would be because there were no grounds for their original demands on Qatar, let alone new sanctions.

The Saudis and their three sheep got suckered by Russian fake news plants and are now standing in front of the world looking like idiots, trying desperately to save face.

The Russians knew that the Saudis wanted Al Jazeera TV (based in Qatar) shut down because it has an embarrassing (for the Saudis) habit of exposing the brutal practices of the Saudi (and Egyptian and Bahrain and UAE) dictatorships.

So the Russians planted some fake news stories about Qatar supporting terrorism and the gormless Saudis bought it, sanctioned Qatar and demanded they shut down Al Jazeera TV.

This worked for the Russians too as Al Jazeera exposes their crimes and those of their allies Iran and Syria.

Saudi suckers.

In my view, the extreme sentences given for sex related offenses that do no physical damage will tend to cost victims their lives because, the perps are not stupid and when killing brings a lesser penalty than not, what are they gonna do.  Furthermore, the best thing to do to mitigate the impact of sexual crimes is to instill victims with enough self-respect to understand that a sex offense does not define them.

Many women--past, present and, possibly, in the future--will continue to offer sexual favours (to husbands, mainly) as a bargaining chip, ""gimme what I want, then maybe I'll give you what you want..."" often it's implicit in years-long relationships. The ultimate ""gimme"" would be the engagement/wedding ring trade off.  Without it...no sex at all.

Simple reasons are 1- they are a thousand pounds lighter; 2- rolling impact is less than stepping; 3- bikers don't graze; and 4- bikes don't leave urine and poop on the trails.

Main reasons for mountain bike damage are unauthorized trails, so if you allow them to build in designated zones, there should be no need for additional trail building; and skidding, which again is mitigated by proper trail design.

 Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama — the country’s first black president — was not born in the US. He even sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama's birth certificate.

Trump has repeatedly referred to Mexican immigrants as “criminals” and “rapists”, plans to build a border wall & force Mexico to pay for it, repeatedly referred to Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas” due to her Cherokee ancestry, called for a complete ban on all Muslims entering the US

"I expect as much silence on this as they had on tRump's p***y grabbing tape. The left tends to have principles on this - witness how they reacted to Weinstein vs. how the right reacts (meaning, virtual media silence) to O'LIElly, Murdoch and pResident P***grab.


Remember: tRump was caught, on tape, BRAGGING ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT. And they still voted for him.


Anyone that watches Faux and voted for tRump is a flaming hypocrite if they only rear up on their hind legs and start bleating about Weinstein now. Remember, O'Reilly's sexual harassment was known about for more than a decade, at least for anyone not deep in denial. He's not called Falafel King for nothing.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
